It's an assurance to each of us beginning this journey that it is possible to get there:

This is Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah.

I'm excited to welcome you to this WhatsApp group #AskPyFesh!

Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
10/23/19, 10:17 PM - +234 706 130 1525: Good evening
10/23/19, 10:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm sure we have all gone through the group description and have an idea what this all about.

I will do quick recap.
10/23/19, 10:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah == Fesh.
So please feel free to use whichever comes faster and more convenient to you.
10/23/19, 10:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This group is geared towards all who are desirous of learning the *python programming language* whatever level they are from beginner to advanced.
10/23/19, 10:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm aware we have some fairly proficient developers here and I'm glad we are here together. Your contributions will be most welcome as we go on.

However, we will start this first event from the *very basics* of learning the language.
10/23/19, 10:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hopefully you have followed this link and your computer is setup to go. If not, you have it there to use.
10/23/19, 10:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If this is the first programming language you are learning then you are in luck.

Python is a high level programming language. This means it is closer to human language than machine language. So pretty much every line of python at a closer look, will be readable just like everyday sentences. Well, mostly.
10/23/19, 10:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the most puzzling questions for me starting off was: _what can I do with the knowledge of this language_

If you have not asked yourself this question, I'm not sure what you can take away from this group but just maybe you will get a bit more clarity after this short session.
10/23/19, 10:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Python is a very versatile language and can be used to develop Python can be used to develop different things like web applications, graphic user interface based applications, software development application, scientific and numeric applications, network programming, Games and 3D applications and other business applications.
10/23/19, 10:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some of the popular services heavily built around python include:
Google
YouTube
Quora
Dropbox
Yahoo
Reddit
Spotify...
10/23/19, 10:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: And... Instagram!
10/23/19, 10:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the factors driving the adoption of this language today is its suitability for data and data related operations.
10/23/19, 10:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of all the various things python can lend itself to, we are mostly going to gravitate towards data analytics and web development. This are arguably two of the most prominent uses of this languages.
10/23/19, 10:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: More so, Python is a magnificent scripting language very good at achieving automation of processes.
10/23/19, 10:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To cap up this introduction at the 15minute mark I am going to ask anyone on their computer to pull up the command prompt so we write our very first python program. It consists of a form of ritual in every language: hello world.
10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you followed the setup text and tested it ok as advised, pull up a command prompt and type 'python' then hit the return key.

You will have the python prompt looking like this

>>>
10/23/19, 10:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Type in

_print("Hello World")_

Hit the return key.
You just wrote your first script in python.
10/23/19, 10:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will now outline some resources we can use for learning.

On a desktop, I will recommend using the *jupyter notebook*

To get it, download and install Anaconda from this link
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

At installation, remember to check the box asking to add it to _PATH_ or _environmental variable_
10/23/19, 10:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have a low memory PC, don't bother installing Anaconda. It might slow things down for you.

You can install jupyter notebook and it's dependencies by opening your command prompt and typing

_pip install jupyter notebook_

I'm presuming you already have python installed and have an internet connection.
10/23/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To launch the notebook, create a new folder somewhere on your desktop, and open it up.

Hold down the shift key and right click on a blank area (making sure nothing is selected if the folder has any contents), select _open command prompt (or powershell) here_ depending on the version of windows you are using.


This opens a command prompt in that very directory/folder/location.

Type:
_jupyter notebook_

Hit enter. The notebook fires up and opens on a browser.

If you are on a Mac or Linux please indicate later if you will need some guidance.
10/23/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you can reach a browser but cannot afford to install packages, the site pythonanywhere.com has resources for you.
10/23/19, 10:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are on a mobile, get the app _SoloLearn_.

The _Code playground_ can be used to write and save code.
10/23/19, 10:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, one of the best _free_ resource I have come across for learning this language is w3schools.com/python

I will refer to it a lot and will practically follow its outline. Make it your encyclopedia.
10/23/19, 10:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will stop here for some questions from the house.
10/23/19, 10:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good evening and welcome once again.
10/23/19, 10:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll call it a day at 11:15pm Lagos time.
10/23/19, 10:51 PM - +234 706 274 2832: Good evening. You said Python is used for web development.

1. Does it mean that HTML, CSS and JavaScript are outdated?
2. I'm a newbie in coding and which would you recommend I learn for web development between python and the ones I listed above?
10/23/19, 10:56 PM - Budo: Python is the way to go
10/23/19, 10:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Web development can be complicated sometimes and many people misunderstand what is required. That said, there are two aspects of web development: the front end and the backend.

The front end is where the items on _1_ in your list come in. JavaScript has frameworks for the back two. Node.js being the most popular.

However, the backend is where the logic is the site resides. This is where python frameworks are a great asset. These include Django and Flask amongst others.

For the web with python, after learning the basics, you will need to zero in on a web framework so you can develop the backend with it. When done, with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you get string a front end to it and have a full site from static to full fledged web apps like e-commerce and game sites.
10/23/19, 10:58 PM - +234 903 182 7815: You can use Python for back end web development. Python web dev frameworks include: Django, Flask and Falcon.
10/23/19, 10:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: HTML and CSS are not programming languages, they are markup languages.
10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 706 274 2832: Ohh thank you very much 🙂
10/23/19, 10:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: HTML and CSS are essential for building a website.
10/23/19, 11:00 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Python comes in as a replacement to PHP not those ones you mentioned.
10/23/19, 11:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many thanks Sam. 👍👍

Let's keep it simple for the beginners and not use too many terms that will confuse them for a take off.

With time they will get the hang of it.
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 706 444 3217: so, Python and PHP can't be used together?
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Noted sir.

Thanks for organizing the platform sir.
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✌
10/23/19, 11:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: No you can't. They both do same thing.
10/23/19, 11:03 PM - +234 706 444 3217: okay
10/23/19, 11:03 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks bro
10/23/19, 11:05 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: @Pascal, which one is betterjupyter or anaconda
10/23/19, 11:06 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Is it advisable to use cmd for coding?
10/23/19, 11:07 PM - +234 706 214 9878: Thanks Fesh for this wonderful session!
10/23/19, 11:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Jupyter notebook is an environment for writing code. Anaconda is an assemblage of tools and libraries put together for ease of use by developers and one of the many environments in it is the jupyter notebook. Spyder is another environment and it is included in the Anaconda package.
10/23/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you went through the reference text you will see that though you can write code in the command prompt after teaching the python prompt, you have no way of saving it.

For that it is not advisable to to do as it is mostly a waste of time.

Use it when you are running your scripts. Something we will get to explain going forward.
10/23/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You are welcome Henry. ✌️
10/23/19, 11:11 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks  Fesh
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I learnt this night
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Any assignment?
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I have that passion
10/23/19, 11:12 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I want to be like u
10/23/19, 11:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The first for you and for all new people is to get your own computer, install python and get the jupyter notebook.

This way you will be ready to kick off. Scroll up a bit and find the installation guide.

Then go ahead to w3schools.com/python and start familiarizing yourself with the basics. Ask questions here when you hit a snag.

Real take homes will come much later as we progress.
10/23/19, 11:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm here to help you get there and far beyond. Just keep moving.
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Thanks Fesh
10/23/19, 11:16 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: When is the meet up ...and the duration.
10/23/19, 11:17 PM - +234 706 753 8706: Hi @2349081987335. Thank you for this amazing group.
10/23/19, 11:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's wrap ladies and gentlemen.

I will answer more questions as they come in on the session we had and generally on beginner stuff. It's important you setup your computer if you want to move along.

For the rest of us who are not totally new, bear with us as we bring the great new guys up to speed.

Meanhwile, drop any questions you have on any level of the language and myself and some experienced folk in here will give you a hand.

Remember _there are several roads to Aba_.

A single issue can be solved in many ways. The best solution is the one that solves the problem. After that you try the fastest and the least resource sapping.

Best regards.
10/23/19, 11:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Meets are in the incubator. We will stay here in the virtual world for a while and contemplate meet ups later. They sure are most likely to come.
10/23/19, 11:21 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: I was actually asking for the time for the session
10/23/19, 11:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
They will be fortnightly if time permits. Either way, they will be announced days ahead.

Thanks for the clarification. ✌
10/23/19, 11:23 PM - Charles Echefu #AskPyFesh: Uwc
10/23/19, 11:25 PM - +234 903 881 9790: Thank you very much @2349081987335 .

From Lagos, do have a good night. And from folks around Africa and the rest of the world here, all the best.

Let's keep tooling up for the future of work and take our place there.
10/23/19, 11:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You are welcome ✌️
10/23/19, 11:40 PM - +234 706 527 3604: ...
10/24/19, 2:10 AM - +234 812 053 1560: Awesome introduction @2349081987335  many thanks for the effort put into this. The contribution too from other experts in the group also help fill in the gaps. Look forward to learning more.
10/24/19, 7:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✌✌
10/24/19, 8:18 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *#PythonTip_byFesh*

Python is object oriented and almost everything in the language is an object. This is a very important aspect that determines a lot of things.

Every object has its ```properties``` and ```methods``` .

To work with each, one need know what properties they posses and what ```method``` they respond to.

To find the type of an object do:
_type(object)_

Eg:
aList = [1, 2, "Fred"]
aTuple = (1, 2, "Fred") 

aList is a python list and possess the properties as well as responds to the methods of a list.

 ```Properties``` : mutable, iterable.
 ```Methods``` : append(), pop(), index(), sort() etc

_aTuple_ is a Tuple.
Essentially a python list but different in that it's ```immutable``` : cannot be changed once created. Responds to two methods _index()_  and _count()_. Being immutable they cannot be sorted, appended to, members popped etc.

The object type determines what properties it possess and what methods it responds to.
10/24/19, 8:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Teaser*: Find the basic data types in python, their properties and the methods they respond to.

Google is your friend.

Good morning from Lagos. ✌

10/24/19, 8:40 AM - +234 812 481 1464: Kudos @2349081987335. Relearning is a very powerful tool in programming. Thank you for the opportunity
10/24/19, 8:44 AM - Budo: I'm getting confused already ooo
10/24/19, 8:46 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Don't worry, scrap that part and ask questions if possible for more clarity.

10/25/19, 9:07 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For the new one, if you will like to be enumerated, please send a message with the tag #AskPyFeshIntro with your name and location.

We shall have an ipython notebook of an analysis of this group with a plot of which locations we joined from. The notebook will be made available on Github and I will share the link here.
10/25/19, 9:09 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For the absolute Python beginners and the rest of us learners, if you want to really learn the language, you *need* to have a laptop or least a PC you can reach on demand.

Then you will need *internet connection from time to time* to download modules.
10/25/19, 9:09 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is not an event, but general info. You can catch up at your own time.
10/25/19, 9:10 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *New _joins_*

For a bit of motivation, go  through this article and the one linked at the end of it.

10/25/19, 9:11 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To setup your computer for writing the language, use this guide:

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-up-python-data-analysis-amah-paschal-chukwuemeka

Ensure the test at the end comes out fine, opening the python prompt.
10/25/19, 9:13 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The tool of choice is jupyter notebook.

I will now outline some resources we can use for learning.

On a desktop, I will recommend using the *jupyter notebook*

To get it, download and install Anaconda from this link
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

At installation, remember to check the box asking to add it to _PATH_ or _environmental variable_

It might throw a warning in red, *ignore* it and proceed. This is so you can reach the notebook at a command prompt.
10/25/19, 9:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, realizing there are a number absolute beginners in the mix, I have decided to push out twice a week begging from today, lessons from w3schools.com/python.

For today, ensure you have setup your PC then cover the topic on that page from _Python Intro_ to _Python Variables_.

It's _readable_ so you can read only. However, for a hands-on experience, pull up your pythin prompt from the command prompt and follow.
10/25/19, 9:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Best of the starting weekend.

10/26/19, 10:40 AM - Adafin: D
10/26/19, 10:40 AM - +234 812 053 1560: C is the correct answer
10/26/19, 10:42 AM - +234 812 053 1560: C is the correct answer dictionary class using the sorted function to iterate within an argument.
10/26/19, 10:44 AM - +234 701 291 2307: I'll go with B, I think the sorted() method will sort only the values.
10/26/19, 11:00 AM - +234 803 711 3263: C is the correct ans
10/26/19, 11:02 AM - +234 810 831 6393: C is the answer
10/26/19, 11:04 AM - +234 812 053 1560: And it returns a new list...
10/26/19, 11:06 AM - +234 803 604 4312: The answer is “C” the sorted functions will arrange alphabetically or in order.... in this situation, the values are the most important arguments to sort hence you get this as output  [‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’]
10/26/19, 11:09 AM - Adafin: C came on as the answer.. I don't know the reason why but run the code and it prints ['A', 'B', 'C']
10/26/19, 11:17 AM - +234 706 214 9878: C is the correct answer.

Why? I'm not sure but I believe it performed a sorting function on the alphabets. Paying attention to only the string values
10/26/19, 11:26 AM - +234 813 855 8745: A and B should be because the sorted function i think doesn't run when you have a list with both strings and numbers
10/26/19, 11:26 AM - +234 813 855 8745: Shouldn't*
10/26/19, 11:27 AM - +234 810 831 6393: It does
10/26/19, 11:31 AM - +234 706 214 9878: It actually does..
10/26/19, 11:32 AM - +234 813 855 8745: You cannot sort a list that contains BOTH string values AND numeric values
10/26/19, 11:32 AM - +234 813 855 8745: You tried it?
10/26/19, 11:34 AM - +234 706 214 9878: This message was deleted

10/26/19, 11:40 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good we are rubbing minds to get at the solution.

But it'd be better if we don't post results of our inquiry.
10/26/19, 11:41 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The spirit of inquiry is great Chuky. Don't bother going the extra mile to convince the house.

The solution will be unveiled at a point with explanation and questions taken

Many thanks for your contribution. ✌️

10/26/19, 11:54 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have no solution yet, try SoloLearn on your mobile. Head to the Code Playground, click *+* and select python to write and run python code.

ie while we wait to see what @2347062149878 uses.

10/26/19, 12:39 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *My Review: Pydroid and SoloLearn*

Pydroid is beautiful! 

It has as good an IDE as SoloLearn's Code Playground but better interpreter. It's able to take user input one by one unlike the Code Playground. More so, it has recourse for install and loading modules. Integrates with Pastebin. For other languages, the owners have other app offering. 

SoloLearn has a full feature learning resource/course and challenge system for practise as well as a large repo of scripts from its user community which includes several other programming and markup languages. 

*Recommendation*
_Running code_ == pydroid
_Learning_ == SoloLearn.

10/26/19, 12:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Solution to this 👆 teaser and explanation drops 9pm Lagos time (2100hrs GMT).
10/26/19, 1:06 PM - +234 703 120 1331: Lol! I like this format
10/26/19, 1:12 PM - +234 818 936 4697: The answer is option A. 
The sorted() function temporarily sorts the Keys only. There might be another way to sort the Values.
10/26/19, 2:58 PM - +1 (587) 434-5627: This is a dictionary and you can't sort one
10/26/19, 3:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sorry please. My bad.

This should be 2200hrs GMT. Lagos time is ahead of GMT by an hour.
10/26/19, 3:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 😁
We have people outside of Nigeria/Lagos so we want everybody to be carried along on their time level.
10/26/19, 3:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I meant 2000hrs GMT please. 🤦🏻‍♂
10/26/19, 3:12 PM - +1 (587) 434-5627: You can sort a dictionary actually but not this way. So none of the options are correct
10/26/19, 3:25 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I have a non related question.

In Spyder, when someone click '.' it brings out options. At the side of some, we have something like f in a circle, some a and something that looks like a c

What does it mean?
10/26/19, 3:55 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Do a screen shot make it easier to answer
10/26/19, 4:00 PM - +234 701 291 2307: <Media omitted>
10/26/19, 4:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
10/26/19, 4:06 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Well looking at your image, I don’t know how much you use python.... but if you are a beginner in python, I think you should ignore these words with double underscore, and learn about that as you progress in python.... but note that they are inbuilt variables for the python
10/26/19, 4:13 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Thank you, I didn't know of the sorted() method until today, so I'm trying to look all dict methods to see what they does
10/26/19, 4:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I don't use spyder a lot but from your screenshot, this is Spyder giving you hints about methods available to you based on what you typed in. Spyder is an advanced IDE so sometimes it is a handful for beginners.

A rough guess is you are dealing with python a dictionary as _values_ is one of the things that popped up at the top.

Stick to simpler IDEs like the jupyter notebook, Atom, Sublime Text (free version), VScode etc, till you get comfortable. 

If you started with Spyder then no issue. You can keep at it if you are going to d with it.
10/26/19, 4:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip on question asking when it relates to coding*

A screenshot can say more than a whole textbook.
On your PC, use the PrtScr (Print screen) button to copy your screen to the clipboard. Many keyboards have it as a Function key so you light need to hold down the _Fn_ key somewhere on the space bar row to have it work.
10/26/19, 6:42 PM - +234 703 120 1331: Sense we not kill you
10/26/19, 7:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 😂
10/26/19, 9:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The answer here is *C*
10/26/19, 9:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: python *sorted()* function on a _dictionary_ will by default return a sorted list of the keys of the dictionary provided they are of similar type (strings vs numbers).
10/26/19, 9:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
10/26/19, 9:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✔️
Reason: default sort by sorted() on a dictionary acts on the keys.
10/26/19, 9:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _sorted(a.values())_

will return a list of the dictionary values sorted provided they are of similar types.
10/26/19, 9:05 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Yea my bad, meant to write “keys” mix up key&values a lot for dict type
10/26/19, 9:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: sort() is a different method that words exclusively on python lists and returns values with inplace, ie, it alters the original list. _sorted()_ returns a fresh list without altering the original and works on any object that is iterable.

10/27/19, 7:48 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Question

Can you give me an instance where sorted() will be used. (Why someone will want a dictionary keys to be sorted)

Thank you
10/27/19, 7:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Any case/scenario where some form of hierarchy is needed in normal or reverse order _sorted()_ will be very handy.

In a data set for analysis, a dictionary holding values user data might need to be sorted alphabetically in ascending or descending order for uniformity and some order.

A dictionary of English words (words for keys and values for meaning) will make more sense sorted alphabetically.

In a webapp where an API call returns a series of JSON query, it might be needful to know which response was received before the order to determine which transaction happened first, or which transactions failed or succeeded.

There are several scenario but these come to my mind now.

10/28/19, 11:34 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Best of the new week to all.

We will discuss a bit about what career paths a python developer can pursue. What kinds of jobs one can land armed with this programming language.
*Time*: 
0945pm _(Lagos Time)_
2045hrs )GMT_
_~15minutes_
10/28/19, 11:42 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Exactly what I want to hear😃👌🏼
10/28/19, 12:56 PM - +234 803 755 9018: Okay.... I will stay tuned
10/28/19, 5:55 PM - +234 805 411 5331: This message was deleted
10/28/19, 9:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello python people.
10/28/19, 9:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good evening. 
Sorry this is coming 2 minutes late.
Apologies.
10/28/19, 9:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I am going to briefly speak about job opportunities for people who know this language well.
10/28/19, 9:21 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *0. Data Science*
This is arguably the hottest portfolio worldwide. It is not so big in Nigeria as say in Europe or the US and Canada, but it is steadily growing in leaps and bounds.
10/28/19, 9:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many people, including hiring organisations misunderstand _data science_ and presume that once it is mentioned, it must be about Machine Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence. No.
10/28/19, 9:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Data Science involves everything from data mining, data cleaning, data engineering, exploratory data analysis, to natural language processing (a favorite of mine), machine learning and artificial intelligence.
10/28/19, 9:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The areas listed above and more (data visualization, data pipeline, big data analytics) are full fledged jobs that companies are asking more and more for today.
10/28/19, 9:25 PM - +234 703 080 5323: 💯
10/28/19, 9:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Python is one of the best tool for these items. Other tools are available too: SQL, R, SASS, SPSS, Tableau, PowerBI, Qlik etc. What python brings to the table (and probably R too) is the fact that, you can, armed with it, go into the _wild_ and retrieve data. The rest need that data ready for them to an extent to work although they are increasing building capacity to get data from more sources. PowerBI for eg is getting more sources added.
10/28/19, 9:29 PM - +234 805 411 5331: OK
10/28/19, 9:29 PM - +234 805 411 5331: After downloading anaconda what next
10/28/19, 9:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To be able to play in this space, apart from the basics of the language, mastery of some libraries are a must. They include numpy, (the ubiquitous) pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib to mention only these here.
10/28/19, 9:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *1. Python Developer*

Severacl companies have python developed systems that are running v2 and need to upgrade to v3. This is especially as v2 support is ending soon. Python developer roles are increasing because of this need to update the code base to v3.
10/28/19, 9:35 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Every organisation today needs a way to track their processes. More so, many are going to the web to stay connected as against using legacy desktop apps. The web removes the need for costly software and updates. 

Python is well suited to process automation and has two rock solid web frameworks: Django (my preferred) and Flask. Companies are out to score people who have knowledge of these frameworks.
10/28/19, 9:36 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Python developers also build data science solutions and make them available on the web.
10/28/19, 9:38 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Companies today hire python developers (data science hands in particular) for several other jobs just know that they have people who can manipulate data in case they need them. So, even for an unrelated role, knowledge of python could give one an advantage as they will feel you are an asset.
10/28/19, 9:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Finally, job titles you will see that require the language include:
_data analyst, business analyst, business intelligence analyst, data engineer, machine learning engineer, data scientist, python developer, django developer_ etc.

For a feeler of what the responsibilities are, search the Jobs section of LinkedIn and other job sites for these titles and see what they list in their description.

10/28/19, 9:41 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Questions till 10pm Lagos time, 2100hrs GMT.
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - +234 816 398 2854: As a business analyst, can you also double as a business analyst, or do you need to have am understanding of business in a small light?
10/28/19, 9:42 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Sorry I meant, as a data analyst, can you also double as a business analyst
10/28/19, 9:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I have some PMs on how to use the jupyter notebook.

If you have installed conda properly as advised (checking the mark to add to PATH) and/or pip installed jupyter notebook, to use the notebook, open your command prompt and type:

_jupyter notebook_
It will start the engine and open the notebook in a browser. At the top right hand corner, click on 'new' and choose _python 3_ to start a notebook.
10/28/19, 9:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
10/28/19, 9:48 PM - +234 903 881 9790: Done
10/28/19, 9:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes you can.
Matter of fact, sometimes recruiters mixed both up.
What is always obtainable is that, to work in an area, apart from being able to manipulate data, you should have a fair amount of knowledge of the operations of that industry. For eg, to work in the banking industry, a knowledge of financial things will always make things easier for you if you take up any of these roles with them. Though you can work with data, you need to still understand what variables are important in determining a possible default in giving a person a loan. It's needed to add to your ability to find correlations between the data points you are provided with.
10/28/19, 9:50 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Sorry you forgot to mention the OOP side of python. Basically the same thing a java programming language does can also be done with python too
10/28/19, 9:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is a good tutorial for working with a jupyter notebook:
https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/
10/28/19, 9:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: More like we have not come to that area yet.
I am presuming it is part of the foundation a learner has to have to feel they are ready to take on roles in this thing of ours.

As it is a topic that is critical and often quite confusing for beginners, I thought to not bother about it yet till we get most people here where they can comfortably tackle it. If we start talking OOP at this stage we might have several _miscarriages_. Dunno if you feel same too.
10/28/19, 9:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, at a point we *must* have to face OOP.
10/28/19, 9:55 PM - +234 903 881 9790: 💪
10/28/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Especially if data science is not where we want to land but versatility to take up any python related role, meaning flexibility to feel a wide range of roles.
10/28/19, 9:56 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I understand.... took my 5 years to fully get a full grasp of OOP learning with Java. So since u were mentioning all the things that could be done hence I thought you missed it. But it’s fine totally agree
10/28/19, 9:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
Cool.
Sorry, Java is brutal guy.
Don't scare us yet though. 😃

If we move well, OOP might just be a breeze and not take us too long to grasp.
I struggled with it at a point too. With my struggle, I believe I know the pain points and can fairly guide anyone ready to get past it.
10/28/19, 9:59 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Thanks for this... cheers

10/28/19, 11:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 🙇
10/29/19, 1:30 AM - +234 813 533 2067: Hello Pascal, I was having this conversation with a friend of mine who is into data science since that's the area I am also looking at, and he told me point blank that using the Spyder IDE is far more preferable to using the jupyter notebook especially if you aren't a fan on working in your browser, what's your take on that Sir?
10/29/19, 7:05 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Whatever works for a learner is good provided it gets the work done.

That said, jupyter notebook is beginner friendly as one learns the basics. Spyder is great but half of the time a beginner will likely be struggling with the interface.

Another thing that influences  IDE preference is the type of project. For Django development, jupyter notebook is practically impossible to use so personally I user any of Sublime Text, Atom or VSCode.

For data science it's not impossible but rather _very strange_ the person is averse to jupyter notebook. 🤔

_PS: had to delete to correct typos_.
10/29/19, 9:09 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: https://code.sololearn.com/cN4x9waIrL2l/?ref=app

*Bonus for today.*

Have you thought of a script that searches Google and returns results organised into a table for easy reference? Above is link to one on SoloLearn.

Even if you are a beginner, you can go through it to see the flow of the code and see if you can make sense of some parts of it.

For more experienced people, it's open to modification and use. You will see how to interact with an API (Google's).

Good morning from Lagos.
10/29/19, 9:11 AM - +234 703 080 5323: Thanks sir
10/29/19, 9:14 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Thank you

Can't really make sense of it all but if I take it apart and start putting it back one by one, I'll probably know what each block does 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

10/29/19, 9:20 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea. It won't run on SoloLearn as some modules need to be imported and their _Code Playround_ doesn't support imports

More so, you will need your own Google dev account keys to pass authentication. If you have one (a breeze to create; minutes) copy the code and run on your computer.
10/29/19, 9:22 AM - +234 903 895 4127: Alright. Let me try do it
10/29/19, 9:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: http://valvepress.com/how-to-create-a-google-custom-search-api-key/

For those interested in giving the code up there a shot, this is how to get the required keys.

If you have a Gmail account or are willing to create one, that's all you really need.

Play with the code, get it to do some things differently. Break it and fix it again if need be.

Have fun.
10/29/19, 9:27 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Yeah that's true

Your aptitude for problem solving is as important (if not more) as your knowledge of a programming language.

10/30/19, 7:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Like the name says, it gets the difference between the two sets.

But unlike _difference_ which returns the difference without touching the original set, it *updates* the affected set and alters it's contents.

So _difference_update_ is an *inplace* operation ie changes/alters the contents of original variable.

Yes ooo... We never get old at asking, learning and learning what we have learnt before again...
11/1/19, 8:58 AM - +234 812 053 1560: @2349081987335 Good morning. I somewhat agree with you but what is expected during an interview when you need to write code? Are you expected to google. Kindly throw some light in this perspective. It would be of help. Especially for some of us just embracing python and considering putting it in our CV. What happens if someone ask you at an interview to come and write some lines of code using for instance lambda; like in my case I know it exists and helpful to shorten code...lol I but I just always seem to google its use case scenarios. You feel me? Is this not tantamount to what we call script kiddie in Security?
11/1/19, 8:59 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Very good question.
11/1/19, 9:04 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have taken any serious coding test/challenge, you will know that though it is timed, it is a take home. Usually you are to submit it within 48-73 hours. Some will even give you a whole week. 

No one expects you to know the details of everything.

What a test wants to determine is your use of the language to solve issues.

So yes, in a test, you can Google to your satisfaction.
11/1/19, 9:04 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 72*
11/1/19, 9:06 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In Whiteboarding interviews, you are generally going to be writing pseudo code if you will ever be required to write code. It will usually be about setting out structures, patterns designs etc.
11/1/19, 9:23 AM - +234 812 053 1560: I dont know if this applies in the Nigerian context. I have met an overzealous interviewer who asked me rubbish on how much I understood python for a Security deployment I was amazed as if it was a developer role. You will not want to know the rest of the crazy story. First I was not allowed to google on my pc he rebuked and rebuffed my attempt to access a google page. 
He insisted I must craft script from inside my head is key. Okay olodo me I failed abi...Rubbish! Lol
11/1/19, 9:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Any interviewer who does that is the real olodo. Get up from there, greet them again and walk away.

You don't wanna work there.

Back in the day, I'd gone to one that gave me a sheet of paper to write code. I wonder what I was thinking. So, yes, there are a lot of confused HRs out there. Don't let them make you think you don't know what you are doing.

A real test should be on a computer. Even if you don't Google, you must need to try one expression or the other to see the outcome. Then if time permits, you might wanna refactor/optimize this and that more efficiency.
11/1/19, 9:39 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/1/19, 9:42 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Once you know what is applicable, you can spot overzealous HRs and know your options. This is part of why I don't like outsourcing firms especially those who don't have dedicated IT headhunters. They will always look for the wrong things and leave you feeling if you really know anything where they are the ones who just don't get it.

Remember, for every challenge/test, just like in real production code, *No particular solution is the most correct by default*. The best is what works, then what uses the least resources etc.

11/2/19, 1:47 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I have 2 questions about Jupyter notebook usage.
1. When working with notebooks when we execute codes in cells multiple times the line numbers dont seem to follow s sequential order. Is there a way to force it to be ascending from ln[1] through ln[n]?

2. Starting up jupyter notebooks usually executes with IE automatically by default. How can we force it to execute with our favourite browser such as Chrome or firefox. I tried to tweak the _config.py file in .jupyter/ but cannot get chrome to auto start; 
After calling jupyter notebook in power shell, I still have to manually copy the path and port 8888 before I can start jupyter in my favourite browser. Any tips?
11/2/19, 1:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 2. Change your default web browser. On Windows go to Cortana or click Start or tap the Windows logo on the keyboard; type 'Default App' and open it. Find your browser and change the default. Jupyter will start opening with it.

1. One trick I use is to first make sure I save the notebook. It autosaves at intervals but for this I expressly click _save_.

Restart the kernel and start executing the cells from the beginning. The numbering will reset to 1 from the first you execute.
11/2/19, 2:07 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Thanks i will check out answer to 2 and revert. I read sometime ago about uncommenting a line in the .config.py file and putting the path for your favourite browser but couldn't get it to work properly. Thanks a lot @2349081987335
11/2/19, 2:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That will work too, (ignoring whatever is the default browser and opening with the designate browser) but it is invasive. You could upset some other things by mistake if you are not careful and break something.
11/2/19, 2:12 PM - +234 812 053 1560: 👍 sure that's true. Will try though and revert to default if I break anything...
11/2/19, 2:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✌
11/2/19, 2:36 PM - +234 812 053 1560: @2349081987335 I found a quick fix for this which worked perfectly. 

I went to the jupyter_notebook_config.py file and added the code under line 267 to automate opening with chrome whenever I call jupyter notebook in powershell. Finding the correct path for your favorite browser should work as well but be careful not to mess with any other settings in the .config file if you are unsure how it works.

SEE CODE TO ADD BELOW:

import webbrowser
webbrowser.register('chrome', None, webbrowser.GenericBrowser(r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe'))
c.NotebookApp.browser = 'chrome'
11/2/19, 3:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. Great. 👍

Like I said, this is an _invasive_ (but permanent) way.

Glad you've sorted it out.

11/2/19, 5:17 PM - +234 803 604 4312: The best option was what paschal advised. Jupyter works with the default browser in your windows system by default. Directory paths are unique and different to individual systems, so the first option is still the easiest bet. Tweeking your config files could turn out really bad. Just ensure you memorized the tweek Incase anything goes wrong so u can easily revert.

Coming up.
11/2/19, 9:45 PM - +234 812 053 1560: ⏰
11/2/19, 9:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello good people.
Apologies!!
11/2/19, 9:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I was carried away.
11/2/19, 9:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If we have looked at w3schools.com/python we will see that there is a great syllable for the language there.
11/2/19, 9:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 9:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I will start from the syntax. What I will note there is that python unlike a language like JavaScript, is sensitive to white line.
11/2/19, 9:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A white line is an empty space.
11/2/19, 9:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In some instance (loops, try/except), there's a compulsory indentation of some lines. The standard value is 4 lines but any consistent spacing will work even if it is a single space.
11/2/19, 9:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Python Variables*
11/2/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In python, the single equal sign _=_ is used for assignment. So to create a variable, you basically choose a name and assign some object to it. For eg:

x = "Goat"
11/2/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, x is a variable. It holds the string _Goat_.
11/2/19, 9:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A very important aspect of the namespace in python is this: walk with me....
11/2/19, 9:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: x is not actually equal to Goat. Goat is something in the namespace and x points to it. Remember this. It will mean a lot down the line.
11/2/19, 9:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It might not make any sense at the moment but you will remember I said it.
11/2/19, 10:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That said, Python Variables have some recommendations for choosing them.
0. Start all variables with a lower an alphabet not a number. 
1. Variables are required commended to start with a lower case letter.
2. Variables must be a continuous word, no spaces in between.
3. If you will want to use two word use either of 2 conventions:
- join them with an underscore (not a hyphen) _one_list_
or
- write them in camelcase _oneList_
11/2/19, 10:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some names are reserved in python. They include words like _if, in else, elif, for, while, try, except, in, not_ etc. These words are usually highlighted in green by different IDEs.
11/2/19, 10:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: They mean particular things in python and _must_ be used for those things alone. We will see them down the line.
11/2/19, 10:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This will do for variables so far.
Summary:
Make a variable by assignment and assignments in python are done with a single equal sign.
11/2/19, 10:04 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Python (Built-in) Data Types*
11/2/19, 10:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are going to do well with python, you must know what type a variable/data is so you will know what properties it has and what methods it responds to
11/2/19, 10:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Unlike, many languages, Python is dynamically typed.
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This means that, objects in python have explicit types. This is part of why python is easy to write (but a little drag as runtime needs to determine types and so execute a bit slower) Most languages declare what type an object is on creation.

However, since version 3.4 or there about, Python introduced static typing which can be used on demand.

Don't bother about this if it makes no sense now. It will down the line.
11/2/19, 10:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: At this stage, for beginners we are going to concern ourselves with the following data types:
11/2/19, 10:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/2/19, 10:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Simply put:
_Python string_ type are everyday alphabets a-zA-Z ie capitals or small. This includes some signs.
11/2/19, 10:11 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: They are written with single or double quotes as a rule. Remember the _x_ variable above that held the string "Goat". Now you know why it is enclosed in quotes.

All strings come with quotes.

Not that x is a variable so can be written without a quote and it will refer to the variable x. However, the variable holds the string _goat_ which must be in quotes.
11/2/19, 10:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The second type is _nunbers_ and pythomg numbers have two types I want us to concern ourselves with:
- _integers_ ie whole numbers: 1,2,33,56,7 etc.
- _floats_ ie numbers with decimal place: 1.0, 4.8, 6.01 etc.
11/2/19, 10:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Forget about complex numbers for now. You'll hardly need them
11/2/19, 10:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will also need to know the _Boolean_ type. This has just two values: true or false.
11/2/19, 10:16 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To find a python type, use the _type()_ method. Pass the object in the bracket. 

To find the type of our variable x from above, do:

_type(x)_

This will return _class str_ which is a string.
11/2/19, 10:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll stop here.
*Questions*
11/2/19, 10:17 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Boolean true or false should be “True” & “False” the “T” & “F” should be uppercase
11/2/19, 10:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Correct.

It's always a capital T and F. Your IDE will show it in a different color.

11/4/19, 6:25 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: @2348036044312
Reading through it I can't find any error. I've not tried to run it for obvious reason. The rest of the code is not available and it would depend on it.

However in I'll point out some things:

When getting things from a form filled in the frontend, unless you are dead sure you have a solid form that can never go wrong, you might wanna get your POST information with a _try/except_ just to be on a safe side since I didn't see you check if the form is valid first. You don't want things breaking there (or anywhere sha) 

1. With this sign up form, you kind of reinvented the wheel. Part of the beauty of Django is that it comes with _batteries_. A builtin Django form would have helped here. There's one at _django.contrib.auth.forms_ you could import the some forms.

That said, it looks like a part of tutorial and the flow of a Django signup is being explained: get POST data from the front, check if email is in use, check if passwords correspond, check if username exists, if it does not, create it, then redirect them to homepage.
11/4/19, 6:29 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Elegantly done. 👍

11/4/19, 8:16 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Hi Pascal.

During the lecture, please assist to educate us on differentiating between list and tuples.
They seem to have same style of bracket.

How do one identify if a sequence is a list or tuple just by looking at it
11/4/19, 8:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip for the week*
This is not really about the python programming language so I beg your pardon. But we can relate to it too.

*History*
For the best of inspiration, read the history of people you admire, that motivate you, that you want to be like.

There's some form of positive kick it gives. You will realize they are normal ordinary human beings who probably did something differently and scored from there. And we can be like them in a form or the other or achieve what they did. They are not ghosts.

So, try reading up about the author of this beautiful language: _Python_. He is _*Guido van Rossum*_. Find out what motivated him and why the name python.
11/4/19, 8:22 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. I will try to remember. But if I don't and you are around just go ahead and chip it in.

By the way _lists_ have square brackets
aList = ["list"] and _tuples_ have the normal bracket
aTuple = ("tuple").

However, maybe you are referring to _dictionaries_ and _sets_ which both are in curly brackets:
dict1 = {"key":"value"}
set1 = {"set"}
11/4/19, 8:22 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Ohh.. Thanks for the clarification..

I appreciate
11/4/19, 8:23 AM - +234 903 182 7815: They don't have same style of brackets. List uses square brackets while tuples uses parenthesis.
11/4/19, 8:24 AM - +234 803 604 4312: @2349081987335 thanks as always. Your advices and notes are always insightful. You are the best. A lovely week ahead. Cheers
11/4/19, 8:24 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Thanks Ribo
11/4/19, 8:25 AM - +234 903 182 7815: Lol.. I am Sam tho.
11/4/19, 8:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 👍
11/4/19, 8:40 AM - +234 803 604 4312: To add tuples: are immutable objects. You can’t change or edit them. 
List: mutable objects, you can change and edit them. 
Most times to change and edit a tuple, you would have to change its type to either a list 
Eg:  x = (1,2,3)
Converting to a list :-  list(x)
11/4/19, 8:58 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good.

11/4/19, 1:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Second teaser seems to be quite interesting.

This is why I said everyone (including myself) can always do with a refresher on python lists.

Never gets old.
11/4/19, 1:46 PM - Francis Obasi D-GASM: No answer
11/4/19, 1:47 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I tell u really helpful
11/4/19, 2:47 PM - +234 706 214 9878: B
11/4/19, 3:10 PM - +234 803 604 4312: This message was deleted
11/4/19, 3:16 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I take my answer back
11/4/19, 3:16 PM - +234 803 604 4312: This is really a brain teaser
11/4/19, 3:16 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I looked at the code again
11/4/19, 3:17 PM - +234 803 604 4312: And it’s a tricky one
11/4/19, 3:20 PM - +234 903 182 7815: C
11/4/19, 3:27 PM - +234 812 481 1464: The answer is not there o
11/4/19, 3:37 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I would stick to “answer not on the list too”
11/4/19, 3:38 PM - +234 812 481 1464: 👍
11/4/19, 3:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Anyone can also tell us what the outcome should be in the case they are convinced its not on the list. It's allowed.
11/4/19, 3:54 PM - +234 815 457 9644: I have to commend @2349081987335 for this teaser. Because of him, I have learnt something new today. For those having doubts about their answer, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7123888/what-is-double-colon-in-numpy-like-in-myarray03?lq=1 should help
11/4/19, 3:59 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Sorry but I don't see the correlation 🤷🏽‍♂
11/4/19, 3:59 PM - +234 701 291 2307: And let's wait for Mr Paschal
11/4/19, 4:00 PM - +234 815 457 9644: The link solves line 7 on the teaser
11/4/19, 4:00 PM - +234 815 457 9644: Okay sir🚶‍♂
11/4/19, 4:07 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Is it ok to talk about the outcome now ?
11/4/19, 4:07 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Nope
11/4/19, 4:07 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Ok then
11/4/19, 4:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's allowed to discuss the answer. So feel free to do so. What will not be appropriate is sharing the result of an actual execution of the code.

 But then to make sure we don't have an undue amount of notifications going out to the members of the group, we are also encouraged to keep our contributions to the barest possible minimum when we can afford to.

If you need to understand something, _there's no limit_ just keep asking. That's the *main aim* of the group.
11/4/19, 4:12 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: Ok
11/4/19, 4:12 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For those who join later, we shared this tip about controlling notifications/alert from this group (and indeed any other Whstaspp group you might be part of).

See it 👇
11/4/19, 4:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Personal Hacking for the Group*

Group notifications are notoriously distracting. To mute this group so you get in when you want, tap the three dots at the top right hand corner and hit _mute notifications_.

11/4/19, 4:18 PM - +234 701 291 2307: You're right, the double colon was explained. Why I said that was coz of the (-).
11/4/19, 4:22 PM - +234 812 481 1464: The answers is B
11/4/19, 4:23 PM - +234 812 481 1464: I have to comment @2349081987335 for this monday teaser. it's a tricky one
11/4/19, 4:24 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Ok let me just explain my reasoning
11/4/19, 4:24 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It’s simple and would make it brief
11/4/19, 4:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: The function applied is “slicing” so negative 1 (-1) is simply saying python should print the list from behind
11/4/19, 4:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: That’s how much I would say
11/4/19, 4:26 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Again the flow of a slice is (start, stop, step)
11/4/19, 4:32 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Sorry, slicing is not a function.
11/4/19, 4:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Method... is that ok now ?
11/4/19, 4:41 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I hope you know the context of “method/ function” is debatable depending on how you view it
11/4/19, 4:42 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It’s termed diff in OOP context as oppose to other type of programming context
11/4/19, 4:42 PM - +234 903 182 7815: It's not even a method sef.
11/4/19, 4:43 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So what is it then ?
11/4/19, 4:45 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Lol... It's just an operation performed on a string, list and tuple. Similar to concatenation and indexing.
11/4/19, 4:48 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Am just aware of this for the first time.... have always known “slice() to be a function but what do you know we learn everyday but I stand to be convinced
11/4/19, 4:48 PM - +234 803 604 4312: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_slice.asp
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Is indexing a function?
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I back my up with a general tutorial
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So am waiting for facts to learn
11/4/19, 4:49 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Remember it’s a learning process for all
11/4/19, 4:50 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah def!
11/4/19, 4:51 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Index is a built in function too boss
11/4/19, 4:51 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Anything that u use as an operation in any programming language has to be a function either imported or called by default
11/4/19, 4:52 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So educate me boss... am opened to learning
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's neither a _function_ nor a _method_.

It called _comprehension_.
In this case, call it _list comprehension_.
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Not all. Some are object or method.
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yes.
11/4/19, 4:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's neither a _function_ nor a _method_.

It's called _comprehension_.
In this case, call it _list comprehension_.
11/4/19, 5:00 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So why is it defined as a function here ?
11/4/19, 5:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's a syntactic move. It operates by _slicing_ an array in some definite way relative to its _index_.

The important thing is to be aware of them and how they operate.
11/4/19, 5:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That is the _slice()_ method for arrays. It's actually a method. 

It's different from _comprehensions_.
11/4/19, 5:05 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Is this: ([::-1]) different from this slice() ?
11/4/19, 5:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Function vs Method*

For easy differentiation, a  python _method_ is a _function_ defined in a python _class_.

That's a crude definition but it will help us remember the technical difference. When we get there we will try and explain it better.
11/4/19, 5:07 PM - +234 803 604 4312: That’s why I said the context makes it diff in a situation of OOP
11/4/19, 5:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Great. 👍
11/4/19, 5:20 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah. I get now. Thanks @2349081987335 @2348036044312
11/4/19, 5:22 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I like this... it’s really a platform for a learning curve... like the teaser was a tricky one thanks again for this paschal!
11/4/19, 5:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I have gone into the python documentation.

It appears _comprehensions_ like this are actually python _slice()_ function/method under the hood.

_under the hood_ are my own words here. Lol.

As per doc.python.org, these notations are abridgements of the method _slice()_. However, they come with a syntactic flavor of dropping the _slice_ and skipping the intermediate step where you initialize the slice before calling it on an array.

There are also extended Slicing like I used in the Teaser.

Thanks to the folks that brought up the discussion. Now we all have learnt something new. I have!
11/4/19, 5:32 PM - +234 803 604 4312: No paschal... thank you for a platform for interactive and debate full and also.... a check of your knowledge, and how much u know... We need more of this.... thanks again
11/4/19, 5:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So answer to *Teaser for the day* is B.
11/4/19, 5:34 PM - +234 803 604 4312: U gave us 2 teasers o. Remember ?
11/4/19, 5:34 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok. Right.
11/4/19, 5:39 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ❌
A mix up please. Wrong answer.
11/4/19, 5:39 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Correct answer is option. D.
11/4/19, 5:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This extended _slice_ notation [::-1] does *one* thing to the object it is executed on: it reverses it.

Very powerful builtin function which can come in handy at different times. To build a palindrome, this will be the perfect kicker.
11/4/19, 5:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, correct answer here is option B.
11/4/19, 5:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Line1: we create a set.
Line2: we create another variable and make it point to the things _numbers_ is pointing.
Line3: we mutate the variable from line1 taking only the first two elements. So we have [1,3].
With [::-1] at print, it is reversed to [3,1]
11/4/19, 6:32 PM - +234 706 502 3777: Thank you @2349081987335 for adding me to this group. 
I must confess I have a lot to learn as these commands looks abstract... Lol
11/4/19, 7:04 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Good evening guys, 
Please quick question,  for an individual in the science line (specifically physics),  what area of python application should the person venture into for problems relating to his field of study?
11/4/19, 7:51 PM - +234 905 488 8162: There are so many problems you can solve using python in physics, such as quantum mechanics, python libraries such as quspin, qskit, etc can help u model a complex quantum system using python also generates eign values and functions, there are numerous applications of python in physics, you can download a text book called PYTHON FOR PHYSICIST.
11/4/19, 7:52 PM - +234 705 579 9202: There's a textbook for that? 
Sweet!! 
Thanks 🙌🏻🙌🏻
11/4/19, 7:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 💪💪💪
11/4/19, 7:54 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Just query Google you would see varieties of them, and check for  quantum python libraries  , it's an edge because QUANTUM COMPUTING IS BECOMING HOT CAKE .
11/4/19, 7:55 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Thanks boss
11/4/19, 7:58 PM - +234 905 488 8162: You are welcome bro. You can message me privately I would introduce u to some sweet projects using python, recently I used linear regression , RELU activation function to train a data obtained from a simple pendulum experiment and the output proved that period (T^2) is directly proportional to the length of the pendulum. Python is just too much..😊
11/4/19, 8:00 PM - +234 705 579 9202: 🔥 🔥 
You're a physicist too?
11/4/19, 8:01 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Products of Galileo
11/4/19, 8:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Beautiful!
For the record I've never heard of these libraries before but I'm not surprised at bit.

Python is a versatile tool.
Explore. 👍
11/4/19, 8:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'll check them out just to have an overview.
11/4/19, 8:05 PM - +234 905 488 8162: Yes boss Qutip, Qiskit etc , just query quantum libraries in python. Thanks for this platform.👍🏼
11/4/19, 8:54 PM - +234 706 502 3777: Wow... This is really incredible. Thanks.
What about those in chemistry
11/5/19, 7:17 AM - +234 813 701 6073: And those in Mathematics too😟
11/5/19, 10:32 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: There's actually a _math_ module in python.
Go ahead and try it by importing math.

_import math_
_math.pi_ #give you the value of pi for eg
_x = 50_
_math.cos(x) #give you the cos of x_

For the retinue of functions just do
help(math) after you have imported math.
For help with a particular function do _help(math.function)

The _help()_ function is available for every object in python.
11/5/19, 4:06 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Hi guys.

Teaser.

If we cast 2 as a boolean, what will it return?
11/5/19, 4:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You want the *True* - th?
11/5/19, 4:17 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Lol..

I'm just curious. I watched a video where casting of types was discussed.
They used 0 and 1 as examples..

Just curious as to what 2,3 or any other asides 0 and 1 will return
11/5/19, 4:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I actually answered.
The answer is *True*
😁
11/5/19, 4:22 PM - +234 706 527 3604: 😀😀

Ohh. That's true.. Thanks
11/5/19, 4:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In python, any number that is not zero is significant even if it is a negative number. Zero is in a sense _insignificant_ and so wouldn't count for anything. That's why casting it to Bool will return *False*.
11/5/19, 4:50 PM - +234 706 214 9878: ✍🏻✍🏻
11/5/19, 4:50 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Thanks
11/5/19, 7:02 PM - +234 813 701 6073: Okay
Thank you
11/6/19, 9:06 AM - +234 703 120 1331: Good morning @2349081987335 kindly share this group invite link.
Thanks.
11/6/19, 10:10 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kk. Sorted. ✌️

11/6/19, 6:43 PM - +234 703 461 5552 joined using this group's invite link
11/7/19, 7:02 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good morning guys.
Been quite here.
11/7/19, 7:03 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, for the more experienced folk in here I have a Teaser.
11/7/19, 7:04 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 7:06 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Remember, _in this script_; not generally in python.
11/7/19, 8:36 AM - +234 701 291 2307: g1 wasn't declared
11/7/19, 8:47 AM - Ogbosho Tupac: I am lost in this one oo
11/7/19, 8:53 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Counting too (I am not really sure)
11/7/19, 9:49 AM - +234 812 053 1560: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🐍 print("python is coming run")
11/7/19, 9:59 AM - +234 815 457 9644: I think it is used to get both the position and the value in g1
11/7/19, 10:00 AM - +234 701 291 2307: I also think that, 
(index, value) 
I = index
Line = value
11/7/19, 10:01 AM - +234 803 604 4312: enumerate():- iterates through a list in context which is “g1”
11/7/19, 10:01 AM - +234 803 604 4312: You are correct (index, value)
11/7/19, 10:03 AM - +234 803 604 4312: Output should be: 
0 value 
1. Value 
2. Value 
3. Value 
4. Value etc
11/7/19, 10:11 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: As far as the screenshot goes, *CORRECT*. But it was declared somewhere before line 1. Not yet an answer to the question per se.
11/7/19, 10:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Your 911 is here 😉
11/7/19, 10:13 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 😃
11/7/19, 10:13 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True... but....
11/7/19, 10:14 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True but that's what the *Teaser* says not to bother about as it is a given on the use of enumerate()
11/7/19, 10:14 AM - +34 689 00 06 09: me too...completely lost ooo
11/7/19, 10:15 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True but that's what the *Teaser* says not to bother about as it is a given on the use of enumerate()
11/7/19, 10:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, it is a trick question. That's what  *Teasers* are about.
11/7/19, 10:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: All who answered on the use of _enumerate()_ are correct. Well, except those that we have called 911 on.
11/7/19, 10:19 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Answer*
_enumerate()_ is completely useless in that script. I mean 100%. If it's removed, it will still work.
*Another Teaser*
Can anyone figure out why or give a reason why this is true, if it is. (But I tell you it is).
11/7/19, 10:20 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Look at the script screenshot again.
11/7/19, 10:21 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/7/19, 10:25 AM - +234 812 053 1560: 💪i really wish this translates to my current knowledge ranking in python on the group...lol
11/7/19, 10:28 AM - +234 803 604 4312: True, it would work without the enumerate(). But if you index to do numbering for the result from the loop then the better use would be with the enumerate(). If not that then you would have to have a counter variable to do the numbering. 

I = 0 
for variable in(g1): 
       ......
11/7/19, 10:28 AM - +234 803 604 4312: *intend to
11/7/19, 10:29 AM - Adafin: This is interesting
11/7/19, 10:32 AM - +234 803 604 4312: Paschal.... python is your turf. Thanks as always
11/7/19, 10:43 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Data analytics stuff
11/7/19, 10:43 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Nice👏👏👏
11/7/19, 10:45 AM - +234 815 457 9644: I guess the reward of getting the teaser should be an explanation on how to get this done in Jupyter
11/7/19, 10:45 AM - +234 816 398 2854: So... you already have the data of everyone chatting on the group. 
Awesome, nice application of data
11/7/19, 10:46 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lol.
Keep moving you will get there. Your tenacity is _noteworthy_.
11/7/19, 10:49 AM - +234 812 053 1560: 🙏
11/7/19, 10:50 AM - +234 903 881 9790: How did you scrawl thid data from here?
11/7/19, 10:50 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True.
Enumerate is pain-free but with a counter it's more manual however it gives more flexibility to the developer to do different things.
11/7/19, 10:50 AM - +234 903 881 9790: You followed @2349081987335
11/7/19, 10:50 AM - +234 816 398 2854: He needs to tell us
11/7/19, 10:51 AM - +234 701 291 2307: I think he exported the chat
11/7/19, 10:51 AM - +234 817 044 9056: My question too
11/7/19, 10:52 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So the clue here is that _i_ is the variable holding the index running with _enumerate()_. Notice that it is used _nowhere_ after it was initialized. So it's a _waste_. The machine does one less job by not holding the index numbering in memory.
11/7/19, 10:52 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 🙇
11/7/19, 10:53 AM - +234 903 881 9790: Teavh us this @2349081987335 

🙌🙌🙌🙌
11/7/19, 10:54 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: @2347012912307 has answered. I simply exported the chat.

Tap the three dots at the top right hand corner, tap *more*, and then *export chat*.
11/7/19, 10:55 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: @2348170449056 and @2348163982854 I hope you now know. You can do it too.
11/7/19, 10:56 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
11/7/19, 10:56 AM - +234 903 881 9790: Good.

Coupled with some technical skills you will teach us.

Exporting the chat won't turn to chart
11/7/19, 10:56 AM - +234 816 398 2854: He used python for data analysis
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - +234 816 398 2854: I understand what he did. 
Just wanted to know how he got the data
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hehe.
Even better, I will share the whole notebook.

Part of the perks of being in here is access to scripts I make public or members make a request of and it is not too private to give out.
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - +234 816 398 2854: And then turned it to csv, files
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Thank you so much. 
I'll love to study it😀😀😀
11/7/19, 10:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
True.
I'll make the script available soon.
11/7/19, 10:58 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Yeah sure. Would do. 
Is it a coincidence that you tagged both me and @2348170449056 together? 🤣🤣🤣
11/7/19, 10:59 AM - +234 817 044 9056: I now know....thanke
11/7/19, 10:59 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 🤣
I'm not a pastor o. I'm an ordinary developer.

Both of you asked something about the same issue.
Lol.
11/7/19, 11:03 AM - +234 903 881 9790: 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
11/7/19, 11:03 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Next up, I will have a summary of our different locations as we participated in the #AskFeshIntro

I've done it halfway but there was a lot of noise in between so it is asking for way more cleaning that I can afford time for.

Anyone interested in cleaning it out further can do so when I share the repository.
11/7/19, 11:33 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: As promised

https://github.com/ifebuche/-AskPyFesh

For the snippet shown herein, start looking from the junction that says:
*IIM Template*
11/7/19, 11:39 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Break it down Bros... So we don't think everything is python script😄
11/7/19, 11:49 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
When the group first started, I asked members to write their preferred name and location with a tag so I can collect it and let us see an infograph of our spread. But some added some other things apart from their name and location making it tricky (so needing more time to clean) to analyse.
That's what I am saying that someone could try to clean it up to get the needed info only: names and location.

I already have all the tweets bearing the intro tag in a csv file in the repository shared some moments ago.
11/7/19, 12:55 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Ok .. Boss😄
11/7/19, 12:56 PM - +234 806 235 5136: We just need to be clear in here.... Cos my head is full am seeing everything now abi coding🤣🤣🤣
11/7/19, 12:57 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Even normal English language sounds like a code to me this days...#lifeofanewbie
11/7/19, 12:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lol. Don't worry.
11/7/19, 12:58 PM - +234 806 235 5136: I understood already🤣
11/7/19, 12:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So for the rest of us in here beginners, don't bother too much about anything that looks or sounds too fancy doesn't make sense yet. In as little as 2 months with a few hours a week, you will get to understand most of what transpires with the rest that are past the  beginning stages.
11/7/19, 12:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: On this note let me announce the next event.

Last time we looked at data types. I encourage you to read those parts up for a refresher at w3schools.com/python.
11/7/19, 1:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We already have one lined up. I wonder how I forgot.
11/7/19, 1:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I wanted to bring all beginners up to speed.

Back in the day, my confusion was *where can I write the code itself and how can I execute it*

I'm considering having this replace what we have scheduled already because it is a part one needs to do in order to stand a good chance of advancing.

If you are studying/learning with just taking note and trying to memorize, you will be surprised how true it is that *you don't know what you are doing*.
11/7/19, 1:05 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: Sth like this
11/7/19, 1:06 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: I know i am a core beginner
11/7/19, 1:06 PM - Ogbosho Tupac: But that comment up @fesh is worrying me
11/7/19, 1:12 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will sort it this Saturday.

Get ready all of you starters:

- Have your laptop or PC ready.
- Install python on your computer. Find practical directions in this article:👇
Setting Up Python for Data Analysis
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/setting-up-python-data-analysis-amah-paschal-chukwuemeka

- download and install Anaconda or, when you finish the step above, with internet connected to your laptop, open a command prompt and type

_pip install jupyter notebook_

Hit enter.

Please get these done or ask for directions to get it done so that by Saturday we can write code and execute it together.
11/7/19, 1:16 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Saturday after Nov 9, we will have a Zoom meeting. I will share the meeting invite next week.

It will be an opportunity to see and hear me guide you through the absolute beginnings live. You will see my desktop (not me) and hear me speak, show and explain.

Get ready. Download zoom on your desktop or on your mobile to join in.
11/7/19, 1:16 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's *Free*.
11/7/19, 1:23 PM - +234 806 235 5136: 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
11/7/19, 1:23 PM - +234 806 235 5136: 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
11/7/19, 2:05 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Thank you
11/7/19, 2:12 PM - +234 816 398 2854: awesome... you also included chats from this morning too, pretty neat 
I checked it out
11/7/19, 2:13 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Quick question @2349081987335. How and why did you clean the chat history txt file into 50 rows of data in the csv format?
I am only curious
11/7/19, 3:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 👍
11/7/19, 3:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You deleted this message
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I noticed that too. Are we just 50 in this group? Let me check...
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For every line of the cleaned chat, I looked for those that had the word "intro" in it and isolated them.

This is why I requested folks joining in to use the tag #AskFeshIntro. I could have used it exactly but I found some used f *r* esh instead of Fesh so I decided to go with intro alone.
11/7/19, 3:08 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Ermmmmm.
So you only analyzed the introduction alone?
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Only around that number engaged in the _intro dance_
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No. I extended the analysis to all chats for the graph that features in the notebook.
11/7/19, 3:09 PM - +234 816 398 2854: So you used the chats with the keyword *"intro"* in them. 

So others that didn't really join in with that hash tag didn't get to be part of the analysis structure 🤨🤔


I see
11/7/19, 3:10 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Yeah I understand sir
11/7/19, 3:10 PM - +234 816 398 2854: I could see that. 
Awesome sir.
Thank you for the notebook
11/7/19, 3:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 👍
11/7/19, 4:14 PM - +234 812 481 1464: Please one question...... How did you get the messages in txt format
11/7/19, 4:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Exporting it from here dumps it in that format.
11/7/19, 4:16 PM - +234 812 481 1464: Oh thanks.... I didnt know that
11/7/19, 4:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kk.
Our job here is to answer questions so more of us will know.
Don't hold any back. 👍
11/8/19, 5:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello good people.

I'm unavoidably absent this weekend so the scheduled meet for tomorrow will no longer hold.

The inconvenience is deeply regretted. We shall pick up from next week.

Questions will still be answered as they come.

Please bear with you. 🙏

11/11/19, 8:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good morning python people. Hope we are enjoying the public holiday.
11/11/19, 8:17 AM - +234 806 235 5136: 😃
11/11/19, 8:17 AM - +234 806 235 5136: 👍🏽
11/11/19, 8:18 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Good morning python teacher
11/11/19, 8:18 AM - +234 816 398 2854: We've not started enjoying it yet
11/11/19, 8:20 AM - +234 806 235 5136: There's more to those without glasses
11/11/19, 8:20 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For this weekend, instead of catching up the missed topic of last weekend, I think we should still go ahead with the planned Zoom meeting.

It is paramount that we give all you need that clarity, what is required to do to be able to write our own code, save it and be already to run it.

If that's the only practical thing you take away from this group, get ready for this weekend. You will be surprised how straightforward it is.
11/11/19, 8:22 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Sir... let's brush Newbies so that they can follow suite please
11/11/19, 8:22 AM - +234 806 235 5136: My humble request
11/11/19, 8:22 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In due time then. ✌️
11/11/19, 8:23 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's my thought too.
The meeting is to make sure absolute beginners can set up and run code be they during events or some of the teasers we share from time to time.

I want everybody here who wants to, to be able not only to read up but be able to write python code.
11/11/19, 8:25 AM - +234 706 502 3777: I will really appreciate this... I'm in this category oo
11/11/19, 8:25 AM - +234 706 502 3777: I want to learn Python for data analysis first... I have installed Python and atom
11/11/19, 8:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's very fine. We all were here at a point. We'll do our best to carry you along.
11/11/19, 8:28 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Thanks
11/11/19, 8:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are yet to, remember to to follow this guide 👆to install and test that it's well done.

Then also install Anaconda if you have enough data. It's around 300MB. If that's a lot on your budget, after installing and testing python as in the guide above, connect to the internet, open _command prompt_ and type
*pip install jupyter notebook*

It will download just the things you need to run jupyter notebook from the command line. I am recommending it for beginners and for all who are looking to do data analytics/science.
11/11/19, 8:30 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Awesome
11/11/19, 9:08 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Last week my printer wanted me to help him generate pins and serial number for 1000 scratch cards he's making for me for the school year.

I thought to make a python script that automatically creates integer PINs and corresponding serial.

It makes 1000 PINs and serials starting from 001. It asks for the length of PIN you want, generates them, then asks for a name to save it with, does so and opens the folder the file was saved in.

https://github.com/ifebuche/PIN-Serial-Generator

This is a practical thing you can do. Can you think of ways to make the script create more than 1000? Play around with the code. Ask questions if you will to understand it more.
11/11/19, 9:10 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I have the code in an ipython notebook as well as a dot py file. We will use both as demo this weekend when we Zoom.

You will see how to run a python script/code/program.
11/11/19, 9:28 AM - Ogbosho Tupac: That will be great
11/11/19, 9:30 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Amazing. 
Looking forward to that

11/11/19, 1:02 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Who Is up to do a quick analysis with #Laptop for developer program
11/11/19, 1:02 PM - +234 903 895 4127: ?
11/11/19, 1:09 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Can a newbie be involved
11/11/19, 1:10 PM - +234 805 326 3849: I can't Wait to get started
11/11/19, 1:43 PM - +234 815 457 9644: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 1:46 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Is value a function?
11/11/19, 1:47 PM - +234 815 457 9644: I want to loop over the list_of_pages list, feeding the two inputs from that list into the drop_rate function I wrote
11/11/19, 1:48 PM - +234 815 457 9644: do you mean for ind, value...? If so, No, it means for index, value (i.e position, and value)
11/11/19, 1:59 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Line 4. You're saying next_val = value[next_index]

So, the value here, is it a function
11/11/19, 2:01 PM - +234 815 457 9644: No it isn't
Oh I see what u mean
11/11/19, 2:02 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Ohh.. Yeah..

Nice one 🙂
11/11/19, 2:03 PM - +234 815 457 9644: So I see the problem, I'm trying to index a value, treating a value like a list, that won't work
11/11/19, 2:03 PM - +234 815 457 9644: The question is, what is the solution
I don't want to use two loops
11/11/19, 2:04 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Next_index, is it a value? Like an integer of float?
11/11/19, 2:09 PM - +234 815 457 9644: In the list, there are 5 integer values
I want to pass them into a function like this

Loop one: my_function(val_1, val_2)
Loop two:
my_funtion(val_2, val_3)
Loop three:
my_function(val_3, val_4)

Etc
11/11/19, 2:14 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Instead of value, use int.

See if it will run and if that will suffice
11/11/19, 3:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _ind_ is running your index of 1-n and _value_ is taking the members of the _iterable_ names _listOfTable_ which appears to be made of of integers. If it is true that it is made up of integers, then that explains the type error you are getting as you are trying to subscribe to an integer. So you yet a TypeError. You can only subscribe to an array.

When you says (on line 4 where the error is)
_next_val = value[next_value]_, for the first iteration what is happening is something like this:

_next_value = 5[1]_

5 is an integer and you can't subscribe/index into it. TypeError occurs.
11/11/19, 3:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: What do you want to achieve so we see what will work for you.
11/11/19, 4:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
Let's see...
11/11/19, 4:03 PM - +234 815 457 9644: <Media omitted>
11/11/19, 4:04 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is a prime candidate for _map()_

Do this:
_[map(function, list)]_
11/11/19, 4:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok. Nice. 👍
11/11/19, 6:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: With more detail on what is needed here, map won't work here.

_map()_ is suited for executing a function over an iterable.

Eg:
11/11/19, 6:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/12/19, 11:21 AM - +234 803 604 4312: Morning guys sorry I was missed the help task yesterday.... was a long day..... glad you finally figured it out.... but likewise, it’s good to know what was wrong in the code if noticed.... looking at “In 53” : using the enumerator method in your for loop... 
the position of the “ind” is the loop using the enumerator method automatically counts your iteration... hence there was no need for the “ind + 1” the program would do automatic increments and count for you using the enumerator method. 

Line 4: definitely has a int in the mix. Since the full code can’t be seen that most likely the reason for the error
11/12/19, 12:07 PM - +234 816 398 2854: wow, how does this work?
11/12/19, 12:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: He's found a working way out. 👍
11/12/19, 12:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you have a function you want to execute on a collection, use _map()_.

In the example, we have a list of figures each corresponding to the radius of a circle and we have a function _area_circle_ that calculated the circumference of a circle.

Instead of using a for loop to call the function on each of the members, map can takes the function and the list as arguments and perform as the function on each member of the list.

The result is a map object (saving memory) which can be unpacked with the _list()_ method.

I printed the map object first and then unpacked it with _list()_
11/12/19, 12:27 PM - +234 812 053 1560: 👍
11/12/19, 3:47 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Beginners in the house, reminder to install python  and jupyter in readiness for this weekend.

11/13/19, 8:50 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _*Meanwhile for the _Zoom Meeting this weekend*_:

Paschal Amah is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.
*Topic*: #AskFeshPy Meeting 0
*Time*: Nov 16, 2019 10:00 PM West Central Africa
*Join Zoom Meeting Link:*
https://zoom.us/j/434878697?pwd=MHJZTllDbFVhUjN3eHYraDZEb2dNUT09
Meeting ID: 434 878 697
*Password*: _will be published 12hrs to start time_
11/13/19, 9:49 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Some interesting resumes have come in. Many thanks. 

We should have had this group earlier than now. I've got requests and openings I was not able to fill but hopefully as they come I will now have recommendations. Permit me to keep all I have got in the kitty. Even if this one does not invite you, once you are open, I will be sending them out hoping folks get a placing from here.

I have opened some and have recommended some updates to them. If  I did with yours and you have the time, please do, for better chances. For technical people like me, I know what I am looking for but we cannot say this for the HR folks who look for what they look for. 🤷‍♂

If you have a github account, add it to your profile and of course LinkedIn. One of your github pages was interesting I had to fork a repo there, hoping I will have time to study it.

Best regards.
11/13/19, 9:51 AM - Adafin: Thanks fesh... Great work!
11/13/19, 9:52 AM - Adafin: We at basic learning levels too are open.. we however has strong excel and visualization skills. 

Python is the one remaining 😁
11/13/19, 9:52 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: My general observation.
In case you didn't know, you can start your CV with your work experience and your education.
If you know you are heavier on the work experience department, start with it!
11/13/19, 9:53 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sure bro.
Different openings require different skills. Hopefully one similar to yours will show up.
11/13/19, 9:55 AM - Chigozie Njoku D-GASM: Hi Fesh, please what's your take on SAS as regards data analytics?
11/13/19, 9:57 AM - Adafin: 🙌🏻👍
11/13/19, 9:57 AM - +234 818 847 1990: Thanks @2349081987335 For this platform and the opportunities that have come and are still coming from it.
11/13/19, 9:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: SAS is a great tool. However it is closed source. Call it proprietary. Compared to open source tools like Python, it will have much less job openings. However, some organisations use it and I have seen postgraduate courses in data analytics offer it.
11/13/19, 9:58 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *PS*
If you know you do not have the requirements for a role, don't bother sending in a note. When it comes to your skills you will know. Many thanks. Meanwhile keep building your skills.
11/13/19, 10:01 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you feel you do not have work experience because you have not been employed for a while, see it this. It is an opportunity for you to take on projects you think an employer will fancy to see on your resume. Take them on, open a github account and have a record of them. It might appear too much of a task now but believe me, two years from now is still another tomorrow and you will look back and wonder why you didn't start.

Start now. It's the best time.
And make sure you are having fun doing it because that makes it easier. If you are not, may be you are in the wrong area?
11/13/19, 10:31 AM - +234 803 604 4312: I have always been glad for this platform and initiative. What you have started and embarked on is of great use.... and if managed well, can change the paradigm. 
Also, there are some of us that would be opened to part-time jobs, remotes jobs and projects that we might be interested in and able to do. I worked for 5month remotely for a us company. So it’s a good initiative and concept you can propose and push too.... that’s what the Andela engine room is built on.... and you could be the pioneer for python as our leader.... lol.... 

Enjoy your day
11/13/19, 10:36 AM - +234 703 120 1331 changed the subject from "#AskPyFesh " to "#AskPyFesh"
11/13/19, 10:48 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No doubt bro.

I will look at the remote opportunities too. It's such an integral part of having coding skills. Personally I'm not the 9-5 fan. I prefer timed deliverables. I don't care if you show up or not unless there's a physical session needed by the nature of the moment. What I insist on is delivery quality and on time. However, that's not what all companies want. Some want to see the guy they are paying sitting down with them even if they are doing nothing. Funny by sad.

So, yes. From remote gigs to projects by me and some senior colleagues, I will try and share them so that the beginners and those short on experience will fill the gap.

Ideas are always welcome.

👍

11/13/19, 11:12 AM - +234 803 604 4312: I totally understand. There’s still a big lag on the concept of tech jobs in Nigeria. Most especially for programmers and analyst. You need an enabling and comfortable space to do your thing. That’s why if you visit the major big tech companies it’s not like your conventional work environment. No programmer or analyst knows it all.... but the key thing is know how to get the resource to get the job done. The mistake employers make is thinking sitting and putting a tab on you makes the work get done. Which is a no. Microsoft for instance did a 4 working days test and performance jumped up 40%. I know for a fact that modern company support the culture of one day out of the 5days you work from home. It is a culture. We really have a lot to be enlightened on.
11/13/19, 11:18 AM - +234 805 326 3849: I am in on this, pls
11/13/19, 12:01 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Please help the web developers in here also.
11/13/19, 12:35 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will get there. Don't worry.
I'm a web developer too so I can handle some decent stuff there.
I presume you work with python. What framework are you using, Django, Flask, Bottle?
11/13/19, 12:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many thanks all.
This window is now *Closed*.

I will forward the CV and they will select two from the list as I was made to understand.
Rgds.
11/13/19, 12:38 PM - +234 815 457 9644: Thanks
11/13/19, 3:43 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Thanks Paschal for all your efforts. I am truly inspired by this selfless kind gesture. And to all who participate here whether beginner or programming Ninja we can come together as one and make this platform a great place if we continue to act in oneness and utmost humility.
I appreciate you all for your inputs especially while learning and let's keep the group alive!
Keep learning! #levelup

11/14/19, 3:59 PM - Adafin: Hello
11/14/19, 3:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, I am going to revoke the join link of this group and it will be mostly permanent.
11/14/19, 4:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is because after this Saturday, we cannot afford to take on absolute beginners again as we must have passed what they will require. Till further notice.

We will only let in people who are on the journey already so we don't take ourselves backwards and distract are forward movement.
11/14/19, 4:01 PM - +234 706 514 6514: Okay Great
11/14/19, 4:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For the latest entrants, we have a live Zoom meeting coming up this weekend on Saturday.

To join in, be prepared by downloading Zoom (Cloud meeting) on your PC or mobile so you can join.
11/14/19, 4:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Features*
- Participants will see a portion or all parts of the host's (my) computer as I show us stuff.
- Participants will hear the host presenting.
- I have set the meeting to disable the audio of all participants as they join so we don't end up at with an Oshodi (😁). (for our non-Nigerian co-learners, that's a rowdy place in Lagos.)
- Participants can send a message to the group (those present in the meeting) or directly to the host. The options will show at your respective end.
- Any participant that wants to ask a question will need to send it as a msg to the host. I will keep an eye on the area for questions. If you want to speak, indicate and I will turn on your audio.

Sadly, we can only go 40 minutes before the free version stops the meeting.

*On joining the meeting* you will be asked to choose a name.

You can join whether you created a Zoom account already or not. You just need to have it installed.

You can enter the meeting ahead of the host if you so desire.

There are other features but these are the ones I want us to note.

In future we can participant and code together by the host ceding access to a participant to type.

*Questions* if any.

Link to the scheduling meeting coming right up. 👇

If you were wondering how to start writing python code and saving it and running it. 
You have seen it now.

This is the very beginning of everything.
You want to work with Andela, Turing or be your own private consultant or work in any other firm with this skill, you are set to start exploring and learning. A good resource is w3schools.com/python, DataCamp and SoloLearn.

Good luck.

11/17/19, 7:50 AM - +234 705 579 9202: I'm trying to execute matplotlib programs on pydroid but it's not responding, 
Does anyone know or have any other mobile app for writing and executing python programs,  or even an online editor aside repl.it (I've tried it's not responding)
11/17/19, 7:50 AM - +234 705 579 9202: Just incase anyone would ask, I'm currently using my mobile for python,  no system for now
11/17/19, 7:53 AM - +234 816 440 2922: Does the matplotlib module come with pydroid?
11/17/19, 8:03 AM - +234 803 604 4312: What’s the ver of pydroid u are using.... morning
11/17/19, 8:28 AM - +234 816 440 2922: I don't use it...
11/17/19, 8:30 AM - +234 803 604 4312: U don’t use pydriod or u don’t know the version ?
11/17/19, 10:25 AM - +234 816 440 2922: I don't use pydroid. I wasn't the one that asked the question.
11/17/19, 10:26 AM - +234 803 604 4312: Oh ok
11/17/19, 10:28 AM - +234 803 604 4312: What version of pydroid are you using... There are accounts of it running on pydriod version 3, and in some instance you might have to do a “pip” install. But sure works
11/17/19, 10:44 AM - +234 705 579 9202: It's in the pip section
11/17/19, 10:46 AM - +234 705 579 9202: 3.1.1
11/17/19, 12:22 PM - +234 803 604 4312: U should be able to use it
11/17/19, 12:22 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Can u share ur code that would help more maybe u are missing something

11/17/19, 12:53 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I think there are some dependencies you need to install in addition on your pydroid format to work
11/17/19, 12:53 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Yes
11/17/19, 12:54 PM - +234 705 579 9202: QT loader? 
Done that
11/17/19, 12:54 PM - +234 705 579 9202: 💔
11/17/19, 12:54 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Yes
11/17/19, 12:54 PM - +234 812 053 1560: And one more I can recall I guess hold let me check
11/17/19, 12:55 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Thanks 
I'd be waiting 🙏🙏🙏
11/17/19, 1:10 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Your code looks good.... it’s obviously the dependencies.  Or something more
11/17/19, 1:11 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Chill, does it have it installed via pip?
11/17/19, 1:12 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I think he said he has it installed already via pip
11/17/19, 1:12 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Pydroid has its inbuilt pip installer
11/17/19, 1:13 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Check if you have PyQt5
11/17/19, 1:13 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Go to your libraries
11/17/19, 1:17 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Also check for pyparsing and ensure you have numpy too
11/17/19, 1:20 PM - +234 705 579 9202: I do bruh
11/17/19, 1:21 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I've not used Pydroid a lot.

Let me take a shot and see what could be the hold up since it had pip. From one of the screenshot, it *could* be the device in question does not have enough memory to handle.
11/17/19, 1:23 PM - +234 803 604 4312: You are very correct.... how did I miss that. If all dependencies are in place and you have the 32bit runtime error then it’s more of an internal memory thing
11/17/19, 1:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Also, ensure you are using QT5.11
11/17/19, 1:25 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Okay I'd check my internal storage
11/17/19, 1:26 PM - +234 705 579 9202: I've tried installing that, 
I don't know where to get it, 
Playstore isn't showing anything
11/17/19, 1:27 PM - +234 803 604 4312: You would need to install that via “pip” that would be run in python. So it’s not a play store thing
11/17/19, 1:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hm.
This Pydroid is really useful.

So, this is what I figured out from my little test.

You don't need _PyQT_ to make a plot. At least I didn't need to install it. I figured it had no place in the sample code so I went ahead without it.

If your issue persists it might be either of _compiler_ or _memory_ issues.

A fix might be u installing Pydroid and it's pip extension if it doesn't go with Pydroid then do a fresh install.
11/17/19, 1:41 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: uninstalling*
11/17/19, 2:04 PM - +234 803 929 4506: Could someone please run me through installing pyroid on an iPhone. I couldn’t find any clear instructions online
11/17/19, 2:10 PM - +234 803 929 4506: Found an app on the App Store. Python3IDE. Have a system but wouldn’t mind learning / coding on the go.
11/17/19, 2:10 PM - +234 803 929 4506: Anyone used this before?
11/17/19, 2:15 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I don’t think there’s a pydroid or any ide for python on IOS. I tried searching too one time but couldn’t find anything concrete
11/17/19, 2:17 PM - +234 803 929 4506: <Media omitted>
11/17/19, 2:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Pydroid doesn't seem to have an offering for iOS devices.

_Pythonista_ is advertised. Can someone on iOS give it a shot.

11/17/19, 2:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Don't trust looks. They could be deceiving. Big time.
11/17/19, 2:23 PM - +234 803 929 4506: True doe

11/17/19, 3:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of course.
11/17/19, 5:01 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Data scientists /analysts in the house, please I would like to know how you analyze questionnaire data
11/17/19, 5:02 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Most especially the one presented on likert scale
11/17/19, 5:03 PM - +234 816 440 2922: I'll be glad to get help here because I'm new to data analysis
11/17/19, 5:06 PM - +234 903 881 9790: Well.

I know spss can handle this well.

But hope python gurus in the house can open our eyes .
11/17/19, 5:22 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I read sometime ago how to create quiz questions and answers using classes, if statements and loops as such it would be possible to analyse same with python but I will leave this to my oga(s) at the top for a more suited answer per analysing questionnaire data.
11/17/19, 5:27 PM - +234 906 883 7990: Likert scale data is mostly categorical. You can use OHE or Label encoding to encode your data for EDA. Then you can standardize for your model or dimension reduction. That's how I'd go about it.
11/17/19, 5:51 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Sir I'll be glad if this can be practicalise in a more step wise order
11/17/19, 7:03 PM - +234 906 883 7990: This message was deleted
11/17/19, 7:04 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It is actually possible to create multiple quiz questions and answer in python using the class object. I have seen it done can whip up the code for you if you want when I have sometime to spare
11/17/19, 7:08 PM - +234 906 883 7990: 1. Do your EDA
2. Depending on the model you want to, for instance if it's Clustering, label encode the data, then you standardise.
3. Instantiate your clustering algorithm.
11/17/19, 7:21 PM - +234 903 182 7815: I have done something on that before. I used for loops and if statement. Although, I also made the stuff random. I made the questions randomly generated.
11/17/19, 7:21 PM - +234 903 182 7815: I created different list for the questions and answers.
11/17/19, 7:27 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I have a question

Thoughts on having a GitHub account?
11/17/19, 7:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: What can be done depends a lot on the data type and what insights are sought.
11/17/19, 7:36 PM - +234 806 235 5136: JS na
11/17/19, 7:38 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Github and git are a life saver. We _will_ look at it for developers in here.
11/17/19, 7:39 PM - +234 806 235 5136: I tot for loop and if statement is found only in JavaScript
11/17/19, 7:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Most things you find in one programming language are there in a way in all others especially the basic building blocks. All loops are basic and ubiquitous.
11/17/19, 7:46 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Someone here please
11/17/19, 7:54 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Not at all. It's an essential structure of a programming language. It's found in any and every programming language.
11/17/19, 7:56 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah. It's important to have a Github account. 

It allows for easy accessibility of your projects.
11/17/19, 9:43 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Can I pm?
11/17/19, 9:53 PM - +234 906 883 7990: Yeah
11/18/19, 11:19 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Thank you
11/18/19, 9:26 PM - +234 805 326 3849: It was a regret that I missed the zoom meeting after several days of preparation. All the same, I hope never to miss the next meeting and kudos to paschal for his effort
11/19/19, 6:36 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No problem.
The link to the video is shared.
11/19/19, 8:06 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good morning good people.
11/19/19, 8:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It has been mostly silent from my end.

No tips and no teasers. They will resume shortly. I have been on a project trying to push it to production in a few days. It's been a solo project and as I haven't had hands to help, it's been on and off. 

Let me invite you to please take a look and critique it for me. Frontend development is not my forte but don't try me on backend/server-side. 😁

This is the temporary link it is sitting on:

fesh.pythonanywhere.com/shop

Please sign up and have a feel around. You can go as far as making a purchase with the *test* card. If you give me some feedback it will be greatly appreciated.

The picture quality are a bit low. I'm aware and working on new product pictures.
11/19/19, 8:13 AM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Good morning sir

11/19/19, 8:28 AM - Adafin: Great
11/19/19, 10:01 AM - +234 803 604 4312: So I checked out your link.... and it looks good for a man that claims his “frontend dev” isn’t a forte. But honestly, looks real good. I check it on my mobile and the templates used didnt clash or overlay each other..... maybe more alignment would make it better(mobile view). But if it’s good on mobile.... then the finish line is in view. 
One question, what was it built on ? Django, HTML&CSS, JS or WP ?
11/19/19, 10:05 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Wow, I want to get to this level too.
It's pretty creative tho
11/19/19, 10:11 AM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: After signing up, and picking a product, I needed to sign in again and reselect the product before it's added to cart.

I noticed that the slide pictures when clicked prompts nothing and does not load.

My observations.
11/19/19, 10:18 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Who is here in Oriental hotel for the DSN AI conference..... let's identify...we could all meet atleast for the first time ..
Thanks😁
11/19/19, 10:25 AM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Did you notify us earlier of the event?
11/19/19, 10:27 AM - +234 806 235 5136: That's nice Bro....
I hope to get to this next....but just to make some queries... I suggest the user interface should be worked on....to make it more glowming and easy/friendly to use

11/19/19, 10:29 AM - +234 803 929 4506: They’re doing amazing things.
11/19/19, 10:29 AM - +234 812 053 1560: Is it open for all to attend. I thought it was based on a pre qualification from a challenge?
11/19/19, 10:29 AM - +234 812 053 1560: I would have loved to attend
11/19/19, 10:30 AM - +234 803 929 4506: Free for all. What you mention, That’s a separate challenge.
11/19/19, 10:30 AM - +234 803 929 4506: Same organization though.
11/19/19, 10:30 AM - +234 803 929 4506: The other is a bootcamp based on prequalification.
11/19/19, 10:31 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Thanks man.
Server-side is 100% Django
Front is a riot 😁: mostly boostrap and some extensive custom CSS then ekko-lightbox, fesh etc. You don't wanna know. I hope to do better at the front or totally ignore it. 

Alignment needs work no doubt. Thanks. 
I developed mobile first. More than 80% of users today are mobile. I have proof, lol.

Many thanks. ✌
11/19/19, 10:32 AM - +234 812 053 1560: This looks good.

11/19/19, 10:33 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Woa! 🙆‍♂

I registered o. 
But I'm not able to make it. 
Been so busy that this morning I had to apologize to two people for not picking up their calls yesterday. 

Hope there will be more opportunities. Otherwise we create one ourselves.
11/19/19, 10:35 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 🤣
True.
Thing is, this is a pro bono work and before you get somebody to do free job it's like asking that Nigeria turns to London. But yea, that is an option always that's why I said I either get better at it or simple toss it.
11/19/19, 10:35 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Thanks man. ✌
11/19/19, 10:36 AM - Adafin: Great.. wish I could help
11/19/19, 10:36 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Are you frontend? What do you use?
11/19/19, 10:37 AM - Adafin: I don't end anywhere bro. I end in excel 😆😁.
11/19/19, 10:37 AM - Adafin: I only wish I could, if I had the skills
11/19/19, 10:38 AM - Adafin: That site really need front end touch.

11/19/19, 10:38 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: oh ok, lol.
It's something one can learn anyway.
11/19/19, 10:39 AM - +234 803 929 4506: But the sight is clean and swift.
11/19/19, 10:39 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It does.
I'm still on it as I type.
11/19/19, 10:40 AM - Adafin: That great. I trust your zeal to get things done anyway. It unprecedented.
11/19/19, 10:40 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Thanks.
I made sure to see that it is _swift_. I hate slow stuff. Impacts users experience negatively.
It is mobile first so everything is expected to line up on mobile.
11/19/19, 10:41 AM - Adafin: Yes it is.. I saw the experience with how items are selected into cart and the check outs. It is swift
11/19/19, 10:41 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Tankio.
11/19/19, 10:42 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's the plan. ✌
11/19/19, 10:46 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hm.
Thanks!

I'll look at that.
Usually after sign up you are required to log in. So that's kind of expected.

The slide at the home page or at the products page? At the products page it show pop up a larger picture. Larger pix not loaded up at the back anyway, but it should pop up what it has at the moment.
Many thanks for the feedback.
11/19/19, 10:48 AM - +234 903 881 9790: This ascertion is correct and data proven.

I just left the server now.

I'm curious why you would wanna do that.

However, achieve that with:

11/19/19, 4:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: There will still be an error.

Pandas DataFrame has an index by default (a property) but no _index()_ method.

11/19/19, 9:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: A good coding question will always include what you want to achieve and a sample of what you have tried and the error message.

The sample is here but the error message is not and what you intend to achieve is missing (though the snippet here is clear enough to decipher it).

You are mixing up indentation. Python is sensitive to whitespace at the start of lines.
11/19/19, 9:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That said
11/19/19, 9:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The first four lines are a _function_. The first line of every function ends with a colon so all the remainder of the function should have a consistent indent (whitespace) at their beginning. Choose a number and stick to it. The standard practice is 4 spaces or just use your tab key on the keyboard.

Once the indentation is added, skip a line for some semantic touch/readability so it becomes obvious that the function has ended, then finish up the rest of the lines starting them from the beginning, ie, giving no space at the beginning as they are not part of the _function_.
11/19/19, 10:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The print statement is ok.

Notice how all the lines below the _def_ keyword line have a consistent space (4) at the beginning. That was the issue.

If you check the primary aim of this group you will see that it is learning through asking questions.


Don't hesitate to ask anytime you have one. You will learn and the rest of us will leant too.

It mustn't be me answering. Anyone can give it a shot. Thank goodness it's coding not aproko.😁 To be correct, your code must check out.

Happy learning. ✌️

11/19/19, 10:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Honestly, I am glad for you paschal and this initiative..... cheers
11/19/19, 10:28 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Yeah.
11/19/19, 10:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The correct answer here is _d_

Partition takes at least one argument. What it does is that it takes a variable produces a 3 item tuple by splits it into three parts.

_index 0_ is the first part, and comprises everything before the argument in the _partition(arg)_.
_index 1_ the argument in the _partition(arg)_
_index 2_ is everything after the argument in _partition(arg)_

In the exercise, _aPoint_ is the argument which is the 3rd element of the variable _test_ ie 'architect'.

When you partition test at _architects_, you have:
_index 0_ as *we are the*
_index 1_ as *architects*
_index 2_ as *of our life*

Combined with regex, the partition method will do wonders for you in NLP.

The correct answer here is _d_

11/19/19, 11:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Great to know you have followed the setup and can write and executes lines of code.

Hope you are using the resources at w3schools.com/python to learn the ropes as we prepare more sessions for beginners.
11/19/19, 11:28 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Thank you Sir. Am not using the site. Presently am on with Sololearn. 
But am gonna include this site now. Thanks again.
11/19/19, 11:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok good.

I'm sure a number of us here can give this a shot without calling names.
This is very good for beginners.
11/20/19, 9:47 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I have a retinue of exercises like this and I intend that we tackle them one by one at our meetings. I will announce a meeting soon and we will start with the first item on this list. Thanks @2347068093373 !

11/20/19, 4:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip for the day*
A good coding question comprises of three parts:

0. What you are trying to achieve.
1. What you have done in attempt to get this done.
2. What error you are encountering (if any) or what you are you getting that is not what you wanted/expected.

1 and 2 will usually involve a screenshot of the code and result. 

These will assist a helper towards getting a definite solution(s) for you.

11/20/19, 5:43 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Thanks for this.

I wrote my first real Python code due to this. 😀😀

I attempted the first question.

Was a bit hard getting the invalid part right.

Programming can be fun mehn. 😀😀
11/20/19, 5:44 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Can we share codes?
11/20/19, 5:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 😃
That's the beginners' fun until you get to a real engineering test and you wonder if you know anything at all. 🤣🤣
11/20/19, 5:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: When we are required to so that we keep convos low and not risk making the group a pain in the posterior from notifications.
11/20/19, 5:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Someone reached out to me earlier for a solution.  I will share with you what I came up with for them to use. Non-beginners should look at it and figure out what is happening. Beginners, look at it and see if you can figure out a line you understand perfectly what it is doing.

11/20/19, 5:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you can (beginner or not), write the code out and try to run it on a sentence or on a whole body of text.

Have fun. ✌
11/20/19, 5:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For beginners, do it this way.

The python function up there (_word_distribution(string)_) is expecting an argument _string_ which is the sentence or article you want to run it on.

eg:
test_sentence = "How many, , many how - , many time, can you many times 'the many time'. Sorry but I sorry sir."
_word_distribution(test_sentence)_

11/20/19, 6:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Wrap input() around the _list_ sign _[ ]_

_a = [input("enter movie name:"]_
11/20/19, 6:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Typo
11/20/19, 6:45 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Wrap input() around the _list_ sign _[ ]_

_a = [input("enter movie name: ")]_
11/20/19, 6:47 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Okay bruh,  but i want to display the list after the user is done inputing all his movie choices,
11/20/19, 6:47 PM - +234 705 579 9202: How do i go about that
11/20/19, 6:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Can I presume that you want them to keep entering movie names until they enter the word 'exit' and the script ends?
11/20/19, 6:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: After printing the a list of their movies.
11/20/19, 6:51 PM - +234 705 579 9202: No. I want them to enter their movie names,  but if along the way they enter "quit" then the program stops, 
But if they don't, they should get a list of movies
11/20/19, 6:52 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok, quit not exit.
11/20/19, 7:00 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Yh
11/20/19, 7:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kk.
On the road.
Will revert.

Let's give an opportunity for others to chime in too.
11/20/19, 10:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
11/20/19, 10:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm assuming the range you put in is an attempt to make the user not exceed first inputs.

I have used counter to take care of that.

The flow is, ask for an input. Provided it is not _exit_, add it to the list of movies, increment _counter_ by one and keep doing so till it gets to 5 at which point you print the movies entered so far and break out of the loop. But if it is _exit_ that is entered, print the movies you have and then break out of the _while_ loop.
11/20/19, 10:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Erm,... you said quit, I don't know why I keep using exit. My bad. But we could as well use _gala_ if you get me, lol.
11/20/19, 10:28 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Awesome stuff, 
Can u copy the code here,  so i can paste it in m pydroid and see the output,  instead of typing it again
11/20/19, 10:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: movies = []
counter = 0
a = input("Enter movie name: ")

while a.lower() != 'exit':
	movies.append(a)
	counter += 1
	if counter == 5:
		print(movies)
		break
	else:
		a = input("Enter movie name: ")
else:
	print(movies)
11/20/19, 10:34 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Awesome stuff, 🙌🏻💥💥
11/20/19, 10:36 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Exercises like these should be posted, 
When learning some of these concepts i never really had problems to apply the concepts to... 

The poster did well, we humbly expect more of this🙏🙏
11/20/19, 10:43 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True.

My concern is throwing off the beginners or those catching on jumping the basics and getting stuck and disillusioned.

However I understand that some others higher on the ladder would need to get better, so we will always try to have a healthy mix.
11/20/19, 10:45 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Okay 
Now i get
🙏🙏
11/20/19, 10:47 PM - +234 818 936 4697: Time is indeed a limiting factor. for the beginners, I'd suggest we access the materials that have been suggested or any other good materials and double up on learning. there's is an overwhelmingly lot to read.

11/21/19, 6:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello good people.

If you have just come join the group, warm welcome.

We are probably closing the door temporarily. This is in an effort to try and drive learning for absolute beginners forward and not get drawn back indefinitely. At least until we can open our doors and again for a new cycle of sorts.
11/21/19, 6:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are new and a beginner and you want to learn this language, raise your hand and repeat after me...
11/21/19, 6:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 😃😃
No need.

Just know that if you want to do this, this is a bright opportunity for you. Don't let it slip through your fingers. If you've been trying and going back, determine to grab it this time.
11/21/19, 6:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Our next Zoom meeting is scheduled as follows:

Time: Nov 23, 2019 10:00 PM West Central Africa

Join Zoom Meeting
https://zoom.us/j/727941856?pwd=ZnVWUFZwREpFdEowbjMrVlljdVBJZz09

Meeting ID: 727 941 856
11/21/19, 6:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you are going to do this, you will need your own laptop for learning and practice. 

To be ready, you have to install python on your computer and the recommended IDE for us is the jupyter notebook.

To make things easier, I will ask that you download and install Anaconda on your PC. It comes with python and the jupyter notebook. 

Get it here:
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Get latest version (3.7 at the moment). 
There are 32 and 64 bit versions. Get the one that corresponds with your OS version. If in doubt, get 32bit.

At installation, *remember* to add conda to *PATH*. Check that button. This is critical. It will throw a red flag but don't mind it, continue.

To test that you installed it correctly, open a command prompt and type _python_ and hit enter. If you get no error, you are good to go. If you do, you didn't check to add it to PATH. Uninstall and install again. Check the button to add to PATH. 

PS: Anaconda is large. You will need at least 500MB or 0.5GB to get it.
11/22/19, 9:47 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: As we head towards _Zoom Meet 1_, beginners will do well do refer to this video of the last meet to see how to get up to speed and follow us:

11/22/19, 12:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I don't know if there are any Django developers in here but I have a tip for them for the day.
11/22/19, 12:32 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip of the Day*
Django humanize

The python web framework that comes with batteries packed, Django, has a set of template filters useful for adding a “human touch” to data.

To activate them, add 'django.contrib.humanize' to your INSTALLED_APPS setting. Once done, use {% load humanize %} in templates you want to apply them and you’ll have access to the following filters:

_apnumber - (returns 1-9 spelled out otherwise returns the number) - 1 becomes one and 10 becomes 10._
_intcomma - 4500 becomes 4,500 (for ints, floats or their string format)_.
_intword - 1000000 becomes 1.0 million._
_naturalday - 21 Nov 2019 becomes yesterday. (Going by today's date)_
_naturaltime - 22 Nov 2019 12:22:30 becomes now. (Going by actual time I typed this)_
_ordinal - 1 becomes 1st._

Example applications. I wanted commas in the price total of my products so it went from
{{ order.shipping_cost }} which returned returns/displays 1500.00
to
{{ order.shipping_cost|intcomma }} which returns 1,500.00

These can be very handy for django developers.
11/22/19, 1:23 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Wow.. Thanks.
11/22/19, 1:23 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Do I need to pip install it from cmd?
11/22/19, 1:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It comes with Django and can only be used in Django. Call it a class/method within Django. 

If you are using pandas for example it is like talking about groupby().
11/22/19, 1:52 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Ok
11/22/19, 9:13 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Hello bosses,  pls
Is there any difference between python pandas and SQL?
11/22/19, 9:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea..A sea of difference actually. Might be a bit hard to detail all of it.

And yes there are several similarities.
11/22/19, 9:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/34357/why-do-people-prefer-pandas-to-sql

Read the approved answer on this link for more light because it needs a whole lot of explanation. Hopefully that clears one or two things up for you.
11/22/19, 9:21 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Okay boss...
Thanks
11/22/19, 9:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Summary:
SQL is the structured query language for database creation and manipulation.

Pandas is a Python library that deals with dataframes. Dataframes are tables and databases are essentially tables too.

The advantage of pandas would be ease of learning curve compared to SQL that can get complex real fast. Moreso, pandas can extract, transform and load (ETL) data. Python can query SQL databases (see Sqlalchemy etc) too. SQL can't touch python, well mostly. 

For purely database applications, SQL will be way more versatile as that is what it lives for. It can also do some analytics if the user has advanced knowledge.

11/23/19, 8:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No o.
We are going to look at the basic foundations covering from variables to if...else statements.
11/23/19, 8:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lol.
I'm sure it critical for absolute beginners.

11/23/19, 11:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll see how that goes.
It's quite unsavory. Even my back failed me here too. 🙄

Well, better results going forward. ✌

Good night all.
11/23/19, 11:47 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Goodnight
11/24/19, 12:14 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Oh dear😟😱
11/24/19, 12:15 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Thank you for taking the time to teach us. Let's hope the morning comes with a resolution🙏🏽. Good night.
11/25/19, 7:57 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good morning good people.

Hope it was a restful weekend.

We will take on the first item on this list later today.
11/25/19, 7:57 AM - +234 813 533 2067: Ok Boss, anticipating
11/25/19, 8:07 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Good morning. Please, would you reshare the list for some of us who joined after it was originally posted?🙏🏽
Thank you
11/25/19, 8:07 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
Very well.

11/25/19, 8:08 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Let's try and give it a shot before I drop the solution video. I'll try and make really shot videos to explain and write solutions.
11/25/19, 8:08 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Thank you, God bless you
11/25/19, 8:09 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Awesome!

Any luck with the video of the last Zoom meeting, please?😬🙈
11/25/19, 8:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yea. About that.
Unfortunately, I can't find any video. What happened was that I had auto record in the first video if that night and when I had to restart the meeting, I did not use that neither did I manual start the recording. That's the only thing that could have happened.

Yes I had my back video (desktop capture) on but apparently, once the mic is engaged by an app, it cannot pick sounds. So I have that back up video but it has non audio to go with. 🤷

Very unfortunate I must say. This is a video that would have been a big refresher and reference for beginners.
11/25/19, 8:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'll be more attentive next time to my settings.

Apologies to all that banked on getting the video. It was a village people moment. I'll make better plans next time.
11/25/19, 8:14 AM - +234 812 481 1464: Thanks Fesh for all your efforts though. Know that you are mostly appreciated
11/25/19, 8:14 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: However, the jupyter notebook is still there and it is fairly commented as I wrote some as we went along. So I will share that notebook shortly.
11/25/19, 8:14 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Tankio. ✌
11/25/19, 8:15 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Oh dear. Not to worry. Maybe there'll be Grace for a remake sometime in future💁🏽😬
11/25/19, 8:16 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Real village people but it's no fault of yours, these things happen. We appreciate all you're doing for us🙏🏽
11/25/19, 8:17 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Thank you so much🙏🏽

11/26/19, 3:12 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Yes that’s the logic, however why does it print ([4,5,2])
11/26/19, 3:12 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Hmmmmm
I think I understand the 4 but where does the 5,2 come from ?

Thank You So Much Guyssss
11/26/19, 3:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: numpy arrays are an interesting animal. 😃
11/26/19, 3:13 PM - +234 818 559 0066: I now understand 🤗
11/26/19, 3:13 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Lol
11/26/19, 3:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Arrays a n-dimensional objects.
11/26/19, 3:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The example in the screenshot is actually doing this:

True 1 2
 +      + +
 3      4 False

ie True + 3, 1 + 4 and 2 + False.
11/26/19, 3:17 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Yes, True
11/26/19, 3:18 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Figured it out after looking at more closely
11/26/19, 3:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You deleted this message
11/26/19, 3:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 👍👍
11/26/19, 3:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is partly correct.
True is any value that is not the numerical 0, the string _None_ and of course _False_.

Anything that is not any of the above 3 evaluates to _False_/zero.

Any other, even if it is a negative number like -8 or 0.0004 is _positive/True_.
11/26/19, 3:26 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Ohhhhh wow, didn’t know those values also evaluate to True. Thanks for that insight

11/26/19, 3:40 PM - +234 701 291 2307: 👌🏽
11/26/19, 4:35 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Further to what my oga have said. If I may explain it a little further from my understanding.
What is going on is adding 2 numpy arrays together.
In this type of addition, the output is simply the sum of corresponding elements. Notice how the middle elements in each array (4) and (1) add to 5
In Python, True is numerically equal to 1, and False is equal to 0. So if you check the math, it all makes sense.
11/26/19, 4:36 PM - +234 812 053 1560: *oga has said...
11/26/19, 4:37 PM - Ray Papa: Baba,we understand. English language and coding are different. Lol

11/27/19, 1:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes.
It is what python was explicitly told to print. Though it is used in the evaluation to determine the result of the if statements, it is not printing the Boolean value _True_ and _False_ but string literal as given in the print() method
11/27/19, 1:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip/Secret for the Day*
medium.com is a site for many wonderdul articles about almost anything.

You can find articles on code solutions for data science and algorithms to data structures and coding challenges/test.

The drag? You can only read so much article in a month (3 or so) for free before coming across the *You read a lot* message and inviting you to pay for unlimited access to articles.

Get over this by either of 2 ways:
- _disable cookies on your browser_.
- _Open the article in your browser's incognito mode_

Read to your fill. 😎

PS: Disabling cookies might have undesirable effects on the rest of your browsing experience so option 2 is more elegant.

11/27/19, 8:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The correct answer here is B.
11/27/19, 8:48 PM - +234 903 182 7815: B
11/27/19, 8:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The _call()_ method take one argument. It evaluates if it has a positive value and prints true if it does and false if not.

call(1-1) is same as call(0).
Since 0 is not positive (remember 0, None and False are _valueless_ entities), it returns *false*.

On call(1-2) which is call(-1), the argument has a positive value since it is  not any of the 3 non-values. So the function evaluate to true.
11/27/19, 8:53 PM - +234 903 182 7815: I guess all values(integer) except 0 evaluates to FALSE.

11/27/19, 8:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You mean True.
11/27/19, 8:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Exactly.
11/27/19, 8:54 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Mistake..

11/28/19, 3:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: But if I may critique:
The difference you outlined is not so obvious. I think I get it perhaps because I already know so to say.

You spend a lot of time drinking water 😄. And, were you saying *Data Analys-tic* or *Data Analytics*? Appears your prompt is too slow or too far off. Like you had a hard time reading it out. 

Great job. 👍👍
Your video production is 100%. 💪💪

I'm sure your next videos will be even better. Keep adding graphics whenever you can, like when you showed the chart and the banners of the upcoming events.

Kudo.

Kindly provide any suggestions and feedback. Thanks.
11/30/19, 4:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: wow. This is a great dataset.
Good EDA so far in the repo.
NLP on select topics in this data can be very very powerful. Nairaland is the quintessential Nigerian digital square.
11/30/19, 4:53 PM - +234 815 457 9644: My thoughts too.
My sentiment analysis needs upgrading definitely
11/30/19, 5:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Topic modelling and summary will be interesting on it too.

Get a real life feeler of what Nigerians care about from their own mouth. It will be like a reality show unscripted. I'll like to work such data sometime.
11/30/19, 5:09 PM - +234 815 457 9644: The link to the dataset is there(its quite heavy). Have a stab at it.

If anyone can share code to the questions I provided at the end, I would be really grateful. That part gave me a lot of headache 😅

12/2/19, 3:33 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Great sir
12/2/19, 5:20 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 5:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
12/2/19, 5:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: code details in the repo
12/2/19, 5:29 PM - +234 705 579 9202: How did u get the data set for the number of messages sent by members of the group?
12/2/19, 5:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Going over the messages one by one and calculating it.
12/2/19, 5:29 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: With code or course.
12/2/19, 5:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: of* course
12/2/19, 5:32 PM - +234 705 579 9202: I don't get, 
Is there a written algorithm  that scans number of messages? 

Or you do that manually and then code the rest of the whole thing?
12/2/19, 5:35 PM - +234 701 291 2307: @2349081987335 is there a way someone can capture the 'joined date'
12/2/19, 5:35 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I write a code to read a copy of the group chat that is exported to text format, clean it up, merger the lines of input by users and have the code sort/group it according to frequency of occurrence of inputs and you have it.
12/2/19, 5:37 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sure.

For it joined, there is an auto msg that says _x joined using this is that_. Iterate over the lines of chat looking for all instances of  _joined using..._ and captured their dates of entry.
12/2/19, 5:39 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Oh
Awesome stuff
💥💥
12/2/19, 5:39 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Join messages do not carry dates so one has to be creative on how to pull the event date.

Personally I will consider taking the date just before the _joined_ entry in the data and use it as date of the join.
12/2/19, 5:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You deleted this message
12/2/19, 5:41 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Just for fun, I might send in later, the most used words by the top 5 commenters. Just to show us a bit of what we can do with data.
12/2/19, 5:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You can have a look at the github repo and see a step by step import, cleaning and analysis of the data to show this detail.
12/2/19, 6:56 PM - +234 703 080 5323: Exactly the same question I have... 😋
12/2/19, 7:12 PM - +234 816 487 2514: Exporting I guess
12/2/19, 7:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes.
Click the three dots at the top right hand corner of the chat when you are in the group and find the option to export chat.
12/2/19, 8:05 PM - +234 816 398 2854: I entered the Billboard of Top 10
12/2/19, 8:09 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Yeah, he explained it the last time he did this operation tho
12/3/19, 12:34 AM - +234 806 235 5136: 💪🏼

12/3/19, 11:17 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Remember Excel files can be tricky.
If the data in it was careless entered with a lot of deletes and copy and pastes, you will end up with so much Nan values i twill make your head spin.
12/3/19, 11:19 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You are no beginner so I'm sure you see what I did there.
12/3/19, 11:24 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Thank you
12/3/19, 11:24 AM - +234 815 457 9644: 🙌🏾
12/3/19, 3:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Beginners. If you have not watched this video please do as we gear up for the next meet tomorrow.

I assure you it is good use of your data. It is the video explanation of the first question in the list we are working with.
12/3/19, 3:54 PM - Ray Papa: 💪🏿💪🏿
12/3/19, 3:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The first here.

12/4/19, 10:12 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Ok
12/4/19, 10:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm afraid Zoom enforced the basic account limit of 40 minutes this time and we have come to the end of the meet.
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Lol
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - +234 806 235 5136: It's ok
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: At least the exercise was tackled after some small basics refresher
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Just continue with the video...then share
12/4/19, 10:52 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Yea....was quite explainable
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: seems we ran out of time
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It stopped the video too I'm afraid but it was recorded alright.
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes we did.
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Ok
12/4/19, 10:53 PM - +234 806 235 5136: I was gono tell you about time

12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The video is converting and we will have it available for replay from tomorrow.
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: saw it too
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Yes, thank you Paschal.
However, Would love to have seen how format{} works.

Can we continue with it the next time ?
12/4/19, 10:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh, that's very thoughtful of you. 
You could have started speaking immediately or if you did, I did not catch it. Or perhaps send a msg. All good still.
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: alright.
12/4/19, 10:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes absolutely. I have used it a number of time and I thought it was time to explain it. We will try and start from there this weekend.
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Alright then
12/4/19, 10:56 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Ok....is there any app  used to compress videos
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Not that I am aware of. Anyone with an idea can let me know so we make the videos smaller in size.
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - +234 806 235 5136: 🤣🤣...you mute me back
12/4/19, 10:57 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Yea
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Right, Lol.
Yes I heard a sound and quickly went to turn it off.
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: I observed that the "sololearn" is more explicit than "w3shools".
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Ray Papa: I followed the meeting to a point b4 the(my) network started misbehaving.
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Ray Papa: Sure
12/4/19, 10:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good.
Use whatever makes is simpler for you. 
The aim is to catch it.
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - +234 806 235 5136: This jupyter looks like joke🤣
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Ray Papa: @2349081987335 Thanks so much
12/4/19, 10:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh, I observed numbers dropping down by one and adding up again. Probably you then. No wahala.
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: yea. thanks alot.
12/4/19, 11:00 PM - Ray Papa: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
12/4/19, 11:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: So, I am going to add the notebook we used to the repository for those who have github to access. I was actually going to show us how to push it to github with git but time ran out. So next time, since Zoom is now on serious mode,  I will jumping straight to the business of the day.
12/4/19, 11:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Have a good night all.
Tomorrow is a work day so I'm sure we must wanna catch some rest.
12/4/19, 11:03 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Good👍🏽
12/4/19, 11:03 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: good night BOSS
12/4/19, 11:03 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Not me
12/4/19, 11:04 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Am here

12/4/19, 11:13 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Yes ooh
12/4/19, 11:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lol.
Go ahead bro.

If you have more time, dig in. Don't think it will always be this way. Utilize it. Don't look back at today and say if I had known.

👍
12/5/19, 11:06 AM - +234 705 579 9202: There are , but the video quality would be drastically reduced

12/5/19, 11:21 PM - +234 903 895 4127: How?
12/5/19, 11:24 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Pydroid3 pip install
12/5/19, 11:24 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Its possible
12/5/19, 11:24 PM - +234 705 579 9202: -Download *Pydroid* from playstore
-open the app >> then go to pip section >> then go to quick install >> then you'd see jupyter as well as other Libraries, install jupyter by clicking "install", (wait for the whole process to be completed) 
-after you've installed jupyter, >> go to the terminal section >> type *Jupyter notebook* and click enter ,
Boom you're in
12/5/19, 11:25 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Yh
12/5/19, 11:32 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Great!🙌

12/6/19, 2:41 PM - +234 818 559 0066: *Good Afternoon Everyone* 

Please I need help solving this problem.

While I understand how to to solve No 1. I don’t quite understand how to solve 2&3 😩
12/6/19, 2:43 PM - +234 818 559 0066: <Media omitted>
12/6/19, 2:44 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I'll check if the speed is greater than 70, if yes, then divide the difference by 2 to get the number of delimiter (the division will you float), if the delimiter is greater than 12, then license suspended
12/6/19, 2:45 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Try this.

If x < 70:
   Print("OK" )
Else if x > 70:
  (x - 70)/ 5 = y
  If int(y) = 1:
Print (demerit point is 1)
12/6/19, 2:46 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Please what is delimiter ?
12/6/19, 2:46 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Demerit sorry, it's in the question
12/6/19, 2:47 PM - +234 818 559 0066: So x is the value of the speed, right ?
12/6/19, 2:48 PM - +234 701 291 2307: This doesn't really capture if the demerit is greater than 12.

I have a question, what if we have something like 73 (not a multiple of 5), what do we do?
12/6/19, 2:49 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Yes
12/6/19, 2:49 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Also what is the purpose of 
(x -70)/5 = y ?

Is y the demerit point ?
12/6/19, 2:49 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Yes
12/6/19, 2:50 PM - +234 706 527 3604: The int value is meant to pick the whole number value and ignore the decimal values
12/6/19, 2:53 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Okay, I think I understand this
12/6/19, 2:53 PM - +234 701 291 2307: def checkd (speed):
    if speed < 70:
        print("okay")
    else:
        delimeter = int((speed - 70) / 5)
        if delimeter > 12:
            print("license suspende")
        else:
            print("points: ",delimeter )
12/6/19, 2:54 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Nooooo
You didn’t have to send the complete solution just yet. 

Was about to work on it myself.
12/6/19, 2:54 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Ohh.. True. I get you now..

I didn't look at the 12 points part
12/6/19, 2:54 PM - +234 815 457 9644: def speed_check(x):
    x = int(x)
    if x <= 70:
        print('OK')
    else:
        result = round((x - 70) / 5, 0)
        print('Points: ' + str(result))

x = input('Input number here: ')
speed_check(x)
12/6/19, 2:55 PM - +234 818 559 0066: But thanks all the same 😊

12/6/19, 3:00 PM - +234 815 457 9644: This is great, I think you should modify for inputs like 70 and 74
12/6/19, 3:41 PM - +234 818 559 0066: def driver_speed(speed):
	
  if speed < 70:

12/6/19, 7:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: On*
12/6/19, 7:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'll fill you in. What did you view last?
12/6/19, 7:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/6/19, 7:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/6/19, 7:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/6/19, 7:36 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Beginners please give this a shot on your own.

Even having looked at the  answer, pull up an IDE and see how far you can go without copying from the submitted solutions.

If you get stuck you can get it here and take a look and correct yourself. You can only know if you know what's up by getting your hands dirty with writing lines of code.
12/6/19, 7:37 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Alright Boss
12/6/19, 7:49 PM - Ray Papa: This is the major thing  I could view from my end😡
12/6/19, 7:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 🙆‍♂
12/6/19, 7:59 PM - Ray Papa: Frankly, I am sad here
12/6/19, 8:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If by chance you will be in Enugu this holiday let's meet up.

12/6/19, 8:06 PM - +91 90290 41544: Hi All,
I have one doubt
12/6/19, 8:06 PM - +91 90290 41544: i am currently working as mainframe developer but i learnt python and trying to make career in that..
12/6/19, 8:07 PM - +91 90290 41544: so what is basic difference between  python developer and ML
12/6/19, 8:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: One of the many things a python developer can do is ML. Machine Learning.

Just one.
12/6/19, 8:11 PM - +91 90290 41544: so from where i can start my career.   i learnt python but didn't worked in industry
12/6/19, 8:11 PM - +91 90290 41544: i am good in statistics
12/6/19, 8:11 PM - +91 90290 41544: reasoning and math
12/6/19, 8:12 PM - +234 803 604 4312: A bracket was missed in this code on line 5.
12/6/19, 8:12 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Closing bracket
12/6/19, 8:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You have a good background then for ML.

Give it a shot.
Cover the basics of the language then veer into the numpy and pandas libraries. After that full throttle into sk learn.

Read up on those.
12/6/19, 8:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True.
Can you resubmit with the closing bracket for beginners who might wanna give it a shot.
12/6/19, 8:17 PM - +91 90290 41544: thanks alot...
12/6/19, 8:39 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: It seems I will too🤔
12/6/19, 9:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Aight.
We'll meet up.
12/6/19, 9:02 PM - Ray Papa: Plz,may someone help me with the steps of installing the jupyter notebook on android?

12/7/19, 12:49 PM - +234 803 604 4312: If I may ask what happens when u run this code ?
12/7/19, 12:50 PM - +234 803 604 4312: And u didn’t close the file after opening it in the code specifically “my_url.close()”
12/7/19, 12:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Wow. Dunno if I understand this well but why would you wanna do this?

Have you considered serializing it as a json file.?
12/7/19, 12:54 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I downloaded some HTML wepage to a folder.

I want to extract some data in each page.

Each html page data is a dict of dict.

I want to have all the dict of dict as a single value to a key in a fresh dictionary.

I want to do something similar to list.append

{key: '1'}
{Key:'1' , '2'}
12/7/19, 12:55 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I don't really know anything about that
12/7/19, 12:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kk.
12/7/19, 12:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm sure you need to do it this way as you got it figured out but did you consider the BeautifulSoup library?
12/7/19, 12:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To what you wanna do
_use a dictionary as the value of a key in another dictionary_
12/7/19, 12:58 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Yes sir
12/7/19, 12:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: new_Dict['key'] = dictionary
12/7/19, 1:00 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I have a loop that produces a dict of dict on each loop.

I don't want to override the value, I just want to add another value to it
12/7/19, 1:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This onloads the dictionary as a value to a key of the new dict.
12/7/19, 1:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok.
12/7/19, 1:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Create an empty dictionary outside your function.

Then inside the function, call it so it can become a local variable.

Eg

new_Dict = {}

def magic:
    global new_Dict

   ...
   new_Dict['key'] = dictionary
12/7/19, 1:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This will increment the new_Dict each time.

12/7/19, 1:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Europe = [un['Continent'] == 'Europe']
12/7/19, 1:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sorry
Europe = un[un['Continent'] == 'Europe']
12/7/19, 1:08 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You are using the normal bracket instead of the square bracket.
12/7/19, 1:48 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Thanks boss. It worked
12/7/19, 2:31 PM - +234 701 291 2307: This didn't seem to work
12/7/19, 2:31 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I tried but I'm not familiar with the library
12/7/19, 2:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Can I see the error message?

Or share repo privately lemme make it work.
12/7/19, 2:47 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I mean it overrides the value.

dic.update(dictionary)
new_dict = {'results':dic} 

This solved it
12/7/19, 2:48 PM - +234 701 291 2307: <Media omitted>
12/7/19, 2:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Instead of
dictionary = {file: dictionary}

dic[file] = dictionary

Would have also done it and the next line removed.

But there are many ways of achieving the same thing.

So what you have works too.
12/7/19, 2:57 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Yes Sir
12/7/19, 2:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 💪
12/7/19, 4:03 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Paschal is right.... beautifulsoup lib would have made ur life much easier achieving this. The more you try to code somethings the more complex it becomes. Python practically almost has a package or two for anything you want to achieve. If it’s HTML or XLM.... beautifulsoup is your man!
12/7/19, 5:06 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Today is for meeting ?🤔🤔
12/7/19, 5:06 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Hope am right🤷🏽‍♂
12/7/19, 5:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes o
12/7/19, 5:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll try and set it up and share details
12/7/19, 5:08 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Ok Sir
12/7/19, 5:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Let me get confirmation in an hour guys.

I'm meant to be on the road tomorrow so I might need time setting up. This is probably why I've not remember to announce the meeting.

Please bear with me. 🙏
12/7/19, 5:24 PM - +234 806 235 5136: It's ok sir
12/7/19, 7:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We won't have a meeting today please.
I've tried to squeeze it in to no avail.

Let's look at next week.
Many thanks for your understanding.
12/7/19, 7:07 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Twice next week😄😄 .. please Sir🙏🏽
12/7/19, 7:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I can't promise but I'll try. If only mornings could work.
12/7/19, 7:18 PM - +234 806 235 5136: It could ooh
12/7/19, 7:27 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll explore it.
12/7/19, 7:38 PM - +234 806 235 5136: Sure💪🏼
12/7/19, 10:08 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Alright Sir. Thank you.
12/8/19, 5:06 PM - Ojonta Semi Bishop Okoye joined using this group's invite link
12/9/19, 2:46 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Good Afternoon 😃 
Please what is the difference between 
*.loc*,  *.iloc*, and *.ix*


Explanations with examples will go a long way.
12/9/19, 3:37 PM - +91 90290 41544: can you please send link to join this group ?
12/9/19, 4:16 PM - +234 705 579 9202: .iloc[] is used to select rows using their index if we don't want to deal with the column name 
*.ix[] also can be used in place of .iloc[]*

While .loc[] is used to make selection based on the column names or row label
12/9/19, 4:19 PM - +234 705 579 9202: .iloc[] works on integer location or the default index, 
.ix works the same way as .iloc (I'd need affirmation on this,  cos to the best of my knowledge it does) 

While .loc[] works on row labels essentially,
12/9/19, 5:20 PM - +234 818 559 0066: Thank you, just needed to clarify. Seems like *iloc and *ix* performs the same thing.
12/9/19, 7:39 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Good evening 

Can python list, dictionary etc be implemented using SQL
12/9/19, 7:41 PM - +234 706 527 3604: Nah
12/9/19, 7:43 PM - +234 701 291 2307: So how can I make the updates I made the first time I run a code to be there the second time I run it and so on?
12/9/19, 7:47 PM - +234 816 815 1567: Yeah .iloc is index based while .loc is label based
12/9/19, 8:28 PM - +234 903 182 7815: I don't understand the question. Can you explain more?
12/9/19, 8:33 PM - +234 803 604 4312: There is a update method for a dict type
12/9/19, 8:34 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Lst = ['a', 'b' ,'c']
Dict = { 'a': '1', 'b':'2', 'c':'3'}

I want to know if I can use SQL to achieve something like this
12/9/19, 8:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: And the basic way I know u modify a list is: 
append() 
clear()
copy()
pop()
remove()
insert()
12/9/19, 8:35 PM - +234 701 291 2307: If I close the script and I run it afresh , I don't think the updates will be there
12/9/19, 8:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Those are the few way I know u can modify a list
12/9/19, 8:36 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It will be there
12/9/19, 8:36 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Just specify what you intend to update in the method with the dict object
12/9/19, 8:37 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Let's say I have a list. 
I asked the user for input, I got 'orange', I added it to the list.

If I close everything and open it back

Will the orange still be in the list?
12/9/19, 8:38 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Yea you would have to append it to your list
12/9/19, 8:39 PM - +234 803 604 4312: For dict type u can update it easily as much as I know
12/9/19, 8:41 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Which DB are you using?
12/9/19, 8:42 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Better you can use ur positional argument to replace it using a for loop enumerate
12/9/19, 8:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Anything you create in python memory by running a script is a goner once the CLI is closed.
12/9/19, 8:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To keep input, you need to write it to a document (txt, csv xls, etc). Perhaps you might want to write it to a database.

And yes, you can use python to write to read and write to an sql db! Python is that cool 😎
12/9/19, 8:57 PM - +234 701 291 2307: That's why I asked this
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I see.
The question wasn't so clear that's why I gave an umbrella idea.
12/9/19, 8:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: sqlite3 and MySQLdb aee python libraries that can connect to sqlite and MySQL respectively.
12/9/19, 8:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: You need to pip install mysqlconnector to use Mysql.
12/9/19, 8:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah... Sqlite3 comes by default.
12/9/19, 8:59 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Just import it and you're good to go.
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/9/19, 9:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/9/19, 9:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For postgresql, psycopg2 is your guy.

So you can do some research and make your choice.

Postgresql is usually what you will want to work with if you anticipate a really large db. You are not likely to if you are doing a personal project. So for that, sqlite will do just fine. No wonder it is a base component of python.
12/9/19, 9:02 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah...
12/9/19, 9:04 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Now I get what you are saying. You don't want to use a list, you want what will hold your data so you can see them anytime. Is that correct?
12/9/19, 9:04 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Yes
12/9/19, 9:05 PM - +234 903 182 7815: You don't want to use a list because you feel when you close CLI, all your information are gone. Is this also correct?
12/9/19, 9:05 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Yes
12/9/19, 9:05 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Then you need a DB.
12/9/19, 9:13 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You deleted this message
12/9/19, 9:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If it's a simple record, just use a text file.

Anticipate the read scenarios and build in markers for reading the file. Then *remember* to put a line break at the end so that on writing the next time you have the cursor already at the end of the document. If you don't, you risk writing to the start of the document each time.

If you use an sql-like db, you will need a viewer to see your db which could be a bummer if it's just a few records you can just open with a text editor and see what's going on.
12/9/19, 9:26 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Thank you

12/11/19, 9:11 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sorry for the radio silence.

I've had to move to the Eastern part of the country, home. I has a nasty experience on the road and I've been trying to get to grips with it and have had a lot to catch up with as much was waiting.

Once I have a breather, we will go full speed before the holiday begins.

I'm looking at next week.
However, I will keep answering questions and giving solutions where you might need a hand.

All the best. ✌
12/11/19, 9:11 AM - MaduDOMINIC: goodmorning Fesh

12/11/19, 9:27 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Good morning.
I hope it wasn't the regular robbery on the highway.
Be safe sir🙇‍♂
12/11/19, 9:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It was actually with SARS.

That's all I can say. Most of us can string together the rest.

However, I was just trying to explain my absence after it was supposed to be active in here so we can learn more.
12/11/19, 9:30 AM - +234 816 398 2854: Ohhh wow, I understand
12/11/19, 9:30 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Many thanks @2348163982854

Sorry for derailing the house. Let's concentrate on the snake now, 😁
12/11/19, 9:31 AM - +234 812 481 1464: So sorry about that
12/11/19, 9:31 AM - +234 816 398 2854: No problem🙇‍♂🙇‍♂🙇‍♂
12/11/19, 9:31 AM - +234 812 481 1464: Yeah.... The snake. 😊
12/11/19, 10:23 AM - +234 806 235 5136: Sorry Man
12/11/19, 10:29 AM - +234 909 462 8134: Good morning, so sorry to hear about your experience. Thank God for bringing you out of it
12/11/19, 10:37 AM - +234 803 604 4312: With permission of paschal I can share project work on python of someone I help with python assignments just to keep the group active
12/11/19, 10:37 AM - +234 803 604 4312: The project assignments comes from a college in Canada
12/11/19, 10:54 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Go ahead!
Teach us one or two things along the way where applicable. Good for the beginners and for the rest of us as a refresher.
12/11/19, 10:55 AM - +234 803 604 4312: Well it’s just tutorials for beginners to task themselves so they can have questions to ask
12/11/19, 10:56 AM - +234 803 604 4312: To keep it all active
12/11/19, 10:56 AM - +234 803 604 4312: Would share as much as I have

12/11/19, 12:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Very good.
12/11/19, 1:58 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Atleast this can keep group active and questions can be asked when the project is attempted
12/11/19, 2:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That's what's up.
12/11/19, 2:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I've taken a look.

This is a good exercise to try out hands on. Let's await questions from beginners who try to attempt it and get stuck.

Meanwhile we will add it to the list of exercises to treat in our meetings.
12/11/19, 3:06 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Is regular expression allowed?
12/11/19, 3:34 PM - +234 705 579 9202: I'd like to see someone try that without regex
12/11/19, 3:50 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Sorry to hear this Fesh it's very disheartening. Please stay safe. God will continue to keep us all.
12/11/19, 3:50 PM - +234 812 053 1560: This is a good one.
12/11/19, 3:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 😁
For the experienced folks, use regex. Submit your sample let's ride it in a test.
12/11/19, 3:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 💪
12/11/19, 3:56 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Regex I believe would make it easier
12/11/19, 3:57 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Without regex way longer and might not meet all the requirements
12/11/19, 3:57 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No doubt.
But if one is not attentive, something might slip through unnoticed.
12/11/19, 3:58 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Exactly...Will attempt it with regex now
12/11/19, 3:58 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Can we submit here?
12/11/19, 3:59 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Or wait a little for others
12/11/19, 3:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
12/11/19, 4:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Every language has an implementation of regular expression (regex) just like python. They are quite handy and very powerful for search, find, replace, match etc operations.
12/11/19, 4:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In python, it is implemented in the _re_ library. Typically, you load/bring it into the namespace by doing _import re_.
12/11/19, 4:10 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Any() should work
12/11/19, 5:22 PM - +234 705 579 9202: My problem currently is how to make my condition pass through all characters in a string (in this case the password)
12/11/19, 5:23 PM - +234 706 527 3604: For every i in.... :
12/11/19, 6:09 PM - +234 705 579 9202: This is becoming an option for me
. But twill lead to many *ifs* yh?
12/11/19, 6:14 PM - +234 701 291 2307: At most 3

and I think two ifs can be combined (not really sure)
If .... and ....:
12/11/19, 6:15 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Phew! Done
12/11/19, 6:15 PM - +234 812 053 1560: 😜
12/11/19, 6:16 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Baba 🙏🙌🏻
Let's see jor
12/11/19, 6:17 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Hope u explained well sha
Cos me i have questions like loads🙈🙈
12/11/19, 6:21 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Yes added the relevant reasonably
12/11/19, 6:25 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Please share let’s see how you achieved it without regex
12/11/19, 6:29 PM - +234 812 053 1560: No with regex
12/11/19, 6:29 PM - +234 812 053 1560: I haven't attempted without regex
12/11/19, 6:29 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Will do tonight

12/11/19, 6:33 PM - +234 812 053 1560: 😊 thanks bro
12/11/19, 6:33 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Yes it will
12/11/19, 6:36 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Sir
I was trying to put all the conditions in one line,  using character classes but squeezing it all in, some conditions weren't met, 
Can someone help with that,?
12/11/19, 6:40 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Will try it but its quiet a tall order to meet all the conditions with a one liner may be my ogas can advise on that
12/11/19, 6:42 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Ok
Cos i was avoiding putting the conditions separately, 
I felt that would be outside the zen of python.
12/11/19, 7:09 PM - +234 812 053 1560: Lol naaa complex is better than complicated.
Regex is already complex you want to complicate it for us in this space.🤣🤣🤣

12/11/19, 7:18 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Try to share your codes.... helps with guiding and having an idea of what you are trying to achieve
12/11/19, 7:26 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I would also advise for good practices.... always use “getpass()” when requesting user input for password. Passwords are meant to be hidden not visible
12/11/19, 7:27 PM - +234 803 604 4312: It has to be imported though

12/11/19, 8:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Nice. 💯
12/11/19, 8:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/11/19, 8:22 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This might lead you to very intricate bugs that'd be hard to spot.

Usually _and's_ will do it for you. But and can be tricky sometimes.
12/11/19, 8:31 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Okay,  but do u have any resource that deals intricately with metacharacters and regex in depth?
12/11/19, 8:59 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is a great refresher
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp
12/11/19, 9:34 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Always available 
Thanks boss
12/11/19, 10:32 PM - +234 803 604 4312: What’s the “” suppose to represent in your code ?
12/11/19, 10:32 PM - +234 803 604 4312: White space ?
12/11/19, 10:33 PM - +234 705 579 9202: yes?
12/11/19, 10:42 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Have you tried writing it like this “\s” as oppose to just “” the problem is that meta character in a bracket () could be interpreted in many forms by python.
12/12/19, 12:00 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Yh tried that last night,  but some conditions were still being evaded
12/12/19, 12:01 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Sir,  @2348036044312 
It would be nice if u periodically make such posts,  it's really insightful,  I really benefitted from yesterday's post
12/12/19, 12:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Cut the “sir” bro.... we are all in this to learn so we are the same. Sure, more post would be coming weekly. The essence is for us to all learn.
12/12/19, 12:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Try to share your screen for the error as much as u can.

12/12/19, 3:59 PM - +234 816 440 2922: So I was carrying out an assumption check on my tests but Shapiro's test gave a p value less than 0.05 and I decided to visualize with p-p plot and histogram

12/12/19, 4:01 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Can we say that this distribution is normal?
12/12/19, 4:28 PM - +234 803 406 5079: Normal distribution will have a bell curve fitted into the histogram
12/12/19, 4:30 PM - +234 803 406 5079: It has the mean=median=mode
12/12/19, 4:30 PM - +234 803 406 5079: Symmetry is about the centre
12/12/19, 4:31 PM - +234 803 406 5079: If these conditions are met, then the data is said to be normally distributed
12/12/19, 4:31 PM - +234 803 406 5079: In practice however, sometimes it is difficult to have this scenario perfectly. So I guess if it is close enough to the above stated conditions, we can take it that way
12/12/19, 4:32 PM - +234 803 406 5079: More insight into this is also encouraged from forum members
12/12/19, 4:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Definitely not evenly distributed. Refer to @2348034065079's tidbits
12/12/19, 4:50 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Thanks boss
12/12/19, 4:52 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Thanks boss
12/12/19, 5:03 PM - +234 816 440 2922: So in this case, can I still proceed with my Welch's t test?
12/12/19, 5:17 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'd need more info to determine this.

However, part of the fun of coding is that you can test stuff out provided you have a threshold you are looking for.

Are you trying to investigate the mean of two different samples you have? That's what an _unequal variance test_ like this is good for. If so, try it and see the result. If not, you might need to look further.
12/12/19, 5:24 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Yes boss. I was actually supposed to perform independent t test before but the assumption of homogeneity was not met that's why I switched to Welch's test. May I share you the codes?
12/12/19, 5:26 PM - +234 816 440 2922: My null hypothesis is that there's no significance difference in purchasing power of Nigeria when there was banking crisis and when there was no banking crisis
12/12/19, 5:27 PM - +234 816 440 2922: The dataset is about African crisis downloaded at kaggle.com
12/12/19, 7:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You could if you don't have a deadline on it. 
My schedule is super tight I'm afraid.

You can drop it here also if you want so the house could chip in from experience or perhaps from the _Overflow_.
12/12/19, 7:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Makes sense.
And you want to investigate this given the data at hand. That's an interesting one.
12/12/19, 7:20 PM - +234 816 440 2922: I'm actually practicing on my own with the dataset. No deadline...
12/12/19, 7:21 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Yes sir
12/12/19, 7:23 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: For want of time, lemme recommend you check medium.com for its application. You'll be surprised what you find.
12/12/19, 7:23 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Application of?
12/12/19, 7:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Welch's t test
12/12/19, 7:24 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Okay...
12/12/19, 7:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: https://pythonfordatascience.org/welch-t-test-python-pandas/

Pull ideas from here.
12/12/19, 7:30 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: https://codingdisciple.com/hypothesis-testing-welch-python.html

Another interesting real life application. Compare dataset properties in the examples with yours to see the way to go.
12/12/19, 7:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I hope the rest of the house can also breeze through the links and even if they are not interested in that area, have a general idea of what hypothesis testing is about and where they are applicable.
12/12/19, 7:37 PM - +234 816 440 2922: God's blessings boss👏🏽👏🏽

12/13/19, 12:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No sir.
Let's look at next week.
12/13/19, 1:03 PM - +234 806 235 5136: It's ok
12/13/19, 2:31 PM - +234 813 533 2067: In addition to what @2348034065079  said, how large is the dataset?
If it's greater than 30, we can assume normality because of C.L.T(central limit theorem).
12/13/19, 2:41 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Hello pyfesh, I am little bit lost how they concluded from this picture that the two groups didn't violate normality.
12/13/19, 2:42 PM - +234 813 533 2067: <Media omitted>
12/13/19, 3:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'm looking at it. Something appears off. 🤔
12/13/19, 3:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is actually correct.

A p value greater than 0.05 assumes normality. So, both datasets (in the source's words) do not violate normality.

0.054... is larger than 0.05.

Hope that clears it.
12/13/19, 5:28 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Yeah.... It's greater than 30
12/13/19, 5:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/13/19, 6:47 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Thanks 😊
12/13/19, 10:41 PM - +234 706 426 5908: I have skill in this regard...but I have not do a real world application on it
12/13/19, 11:27 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Shoot your shots. You have got nothing to loose. Worst case scenario, you get rejected. Best case you clinch the job
12/13/19, 11:28 PM - +234 813 533 2067: If the kurtosis of the data is exactly 3, it's normal. 
What is the exact size of the sample size?

It's been great for me away from the bustle of Lagos. The Nigerian Harmattan showed up pretty hard today.
12/14/19, 1:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I've decided to dedicate all of next week to our beginner co-learners and the rest of us who will fancy a refresher. 

We will have a 45 minute _Zoom Meet_ everyday of next week from Tuesday through Saturday at 10pm Nigerian time.
12/14/19, 1:35 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hoping all beginners will plan ahead and try to take advantage of this little time to move forward.

I'll drop a little guide of the proposed python real estate to cover soon.

12/14/19, 7:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Remember, knowing the _type_ a variable/object is in python is one of the most important things in working with them.

It is with this knowledge you know their properties and the method(s) they respond to.

A goat bleats and a lion roars, not the other way round. If you forget, you risk being eaten by a lion or missing a free goat for this season.

Can _do_? It's for a contact not me directly.

12/17/19, 9:53 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of course. This is the definition of a remote gig.
12/17/19, 9:54 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: I'll wait for one more and send the contacts. They will pick one.

PS: a very decent job but could lead to others if the guy is impressed.

That's what networking is about.
12/17/19, 9:58 AM - +234 703 281 5348: Yes can do

12/17/19, 7:59 PM - +234 813 533 2067: I tried saving a dataset from the internet to my laptop using Pandas.
12/17/19, 7:59 PM - +234 813 533 2067: I used the df.to_csv format but noticed the new file was having an extra column. How can I correct this?
12/17/19, 8:00 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Ese pupó
12/17/19, 8:01 PM - +234 706 860 9792: From the internet do you mean your localhost
12/17/19, 8:05 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Disable index while writing to csv by adding the parameter _index=False_

eg: 
_df.to_csv("test.csv", index=False)
12/17/19, 8:05 PM - +234 813 533 2067: That's why, it's good to ask oh. 
Problem solved. Thanks boss.
12/17/19, 8:07 PM - +234 706 860 9792: Wow!!!
12/17/19, 8:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: In this business, *questions* are like gold.

12/17/19, 8:11 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Or any similar python IDLE
12/17/19, 8:13 PM - +234 705 579 9202: You'd download pydroid first,  then install jupyter from the pip section
12/17/19, 8:14 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/17/19, 8:14 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Thanks so much
12/17/19, 8:15 PM - Ray Papa: To do this, follow the following steps: -Download *Pydroid* from playstore
-open the app >> then go to pip section >> then go to quick install >> then you'd see jupyter as well as other Libraries, install jupyter by clicking "install", (wait for the whole process to be completed) 
-after you've installed jupyter, >> go to the terminal section >> type *Jupyter notebook* and click enter ,
Boom you're in
12/17/19, 8:16 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Alright thanks

12/17/19, 8:24 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Nothing can beat learning at the feet from an experienced fellow. 

Sometimes,  you would be looking at the solutions but can't understand why..
12/17/19, 8:25 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: True that.
12/17/19, 8:28 PM - +234 706 860 9792: Fact

12/17/19, 8:36 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Buying a laptop is better.

Mobile devices will always be limited in what they can do.

Use them when you risk missing out on learning for lack of a computer.

Recap:
Python built=in types: strings, ints, floats. String formatting with _.format()_ , the for loop and the while loop.
12/17/19, 10:43 PM - Ray Papa: It dealt with me
12/17/19, 10:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Chai.

12/17/19, 10:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No you won't.
That's actually a great option to use and save the data for downloading the shared video as it would have been recorded locally on your device.👍

12/17/19, 10:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Tomorrow we will use at taking inputs from a user and reading a file.
12/17/19, 10:51 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: To whet your appetite, if you have the time, look at this script and see how it takes a user input, sees if a fruit is in the store and tells the user if it is there or not.

12/18/19, 4:00 PM - Adafin: <Media omitted>
12/18/19, 4:01 PM - Adafin: The problem this indentation will cause.. it an entire headache
12/18/19, 4:11 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We'll remember to touch on it.

One tip. Use IDEs as they will complete indentation for you and also highlight it when you get it wrong.

You almost will never need to use the python prompt unless you are test running queries in say Django models.
12/18/19, 4:14 PM - Adafin: I am using a repl.it online IDE but it won't even run some simple function
12/18/19, 4:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Time to switch.
Any IDE that won't do indents for you is totally not worth it. You should concentrate on your code not indentation.
12/18/19, 4:33 PM - Adafin: Python anywhere doesn't either
12/18/19, 4:35 PM - Adafin: I can't install python on desktop.. so I want an online environment
12/18/19, 5:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok.
There are other options. I'll post them in a minute
12/18/19, 5:37 PM - Adafin: Thanks boss
12/18/19, 9:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Meeting starting in a couple minutes.

12/18/19, 10:47 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: yeah
12/18/19, 10:52 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Summary of this Meeting:
We looked at the python _list_, it's comprehension/slicing and looping through it. We also looked at taking user input as well as creating and writing to a text file.

With these, we can now take a user input and write it to s file. Notebook of the lesson below and video at the end of the week or before.
12/18/19, 10:58 PM - Ojei Toritsemoshe D-GASM: Okay sir... But I didn't really understood d last part
12/18/19, 11:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We will start the next session with the last item we talked about so another chance is moro. Plus i\m dropping the video now for a chance to refresh and catch up for you and others who did not join in but want to see if they can join and catch up.
12/18/19, 11:00 PM - +234 806 235 5136: It's easier to loop with python than JS 🤣🤣
12/18/19, 11:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: No doubt. JS will confuse you to alaba and back. But with practise you will get it.

12/19/19, 8:08 AM - +234 813 533 2067: Sylvester Akpan Aka Dj Grasshopper has always been hankering after marriage right from year one in school. He wouldn't let us hear word 🙄

He would chase after girls and sing to any girl who cares to listen to him.

"I need a girl to ride ride ride 
I need a girl to be my wife
I need a girl who's mine all mine
I need a girl in my life!"

The girls never took him serious.

In our third year, he met a very beautiful girl by the name Ifeoma.
He stalked her until he got a chance to talk to her. He cornered her at the library and began singing to her. 

"Ifeoma, Ifeoma, Ifeoma 
I want to marry you
Give me your love
Give me your love
I want to marry you"

Ifeoma's head swelled and she gave him her love.

They dated for close to two years before breaking up.

I accosted Sylvester and inquired about his relationship with Ifeoma, he couldn't utter a word. I then asked him what he has been up to since the breakup.

He began singing to me. 

"Man I've been searching for...for true love
Im gonna keep right on searching till I find
Nothing good comes easy, this I know
Gotta keep right on searching till I find."

We lost contact with each other after we graduated from the school.

Three years later, by a chance encounter, I met him in a barbing saloon. I asked him if he was married. 

He said "no". I asked him when he was going to get married. He shrugged in resignation and began singing.

"Que será, será
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours to see
Que será, será"

I later got to learn that Sylvester had repented and became a born again Christian. He had joined two service units in church and began chopping the single girls.

He would walk up to a fine girl in church and say, "Beautiful daughter of Zion, the spirit ministered to me and told me that you are my wife."
He deceived many gullible female choiresters and ushers in the church with false marriage promises.

Last night, I saw Sylvester again. He was returning from the club late at night, his arms wrapped around two plus sized chicks.

I shouted at him, "Sylvester Akpan, I thought you have repented! You are carrying two big ladies at the same time! How will you be able to service them with your lanky frame? Is this how you are going to do and marry?"

Sylvester turned back and sang to me. 

"This life I can't kill myself
I can't kill myself o
I can't kill myself
Allow me to flex o"

I shook my head and exclaimed, "Chai! Some mothers do have them!"

12/19/19, 9:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We saw the _append()_ method yesterday.

It adds an item at the end of list.

_extend()_ does the same but with a nuance to it. Do you know what? Do you know how it determines the correct answer in this Teaser? Explore it.

Tip:
One (append) drops a pack of biscuits and the other (extend) opens and empties the pack into a container.

12/19/19, 4:52 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Can you show us the very last line of the error message. That's where the clue as to what is wrong will be.

What is visible/showed in your snapshot is part of the stack trace.
12/19/19, 4:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You probably have a _NaN or _null_ value in a row or more of column that is messing with things.
12/19/19, 4:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Of course.
✌
I'm sure everyone musta figure it was inadvertently posted.

12/19/19, 9:09 PM - +234 815 457 9644: 1) You can remove it, delete the row
2) You can replace it with the mean or median of that column
3) You can manually input a value of your choice
12/19/19, 9:10 PM - +234 803 604 4312: You would just replace the column with question mark “NaN”
12/19/19, 9:42 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Thanks Uche.
12/19/19, 9:42 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Thanks Ribo.
12/19/19, 9:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Good.
12/19/19, 9:49 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: It's obvious it is a value that don't play nicely with the _int()_ method that is causing the problem.

If you have gotten past that line then good, if not, use a try...except switch. Don't express convert to  int. Try to, and under except, decide to input an average/mean or drop the row. In some cases you might consider repeating the immediate past/preceding value. It is a technical decision depending on the type and properties of your data. I would gravitate towards dropping the row by default if the occurrence is minimal.

12/19/19, 11:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Summary of today's Meeting*
- more _list_ comprehension
- solving the _Thursday Teaser_ we dropped earlier in the day
- _open()_ method and the nice way to open a file so python closes it for you instead of risking forgetting to close
- different open modes and preference for the 'a' or append mode.
- Putting a number of things we have learnt together in a script that takes user input and writes it to a file.

Jupyter notebook and video coming soon.

12/20/19, 10:26 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Very True.
I have dropped all the videos of the Marathon here so far and I will try to do that consistently from now on.

At the end there will be a link for all of them in one place for easy reference.
12/20/19, 10:28 AM - +234 806 235 5136: 👍🏽
12/20/19, 7:23 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Hello everyone, from yesterday question. I figured more than one row had missing values which in this case happened to be question mark. I had to go through each row manually to check the errors and fix it.
Is there a way that you can know which rows in a column that has missing values? instead of going through the manual route..
12/20/19, 7:26 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Yep.... you can use the “isnull()
12/20/19, 7:27 PM - +234 803 604 4312: This would tell you if you Boolean value of empty column
12/20/19, 7:28 PM - +234 803 604 4312: U can also you it like this .isnull().sum() to get the number of null in a column
12/20/19, 7:33 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Would the _isnull()_ catch an occurrence of a question mark?
12/20/19, 7:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: No it won’t.... I responded based on his question... “missing values”
12/20/19, 7:36 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Please note.... isnull() won’t catch “?” Mark
12/20/19, 7:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kk.

A good EDA is required to sort things like this out.

This is a classical case for a combination of the _lambda_ and _map_.

Seems he has solved it though but had to go manual way.
12/20/19, 9:10 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Good evening house, I learnt something new and I don't really understand, so I don't know if someone can explain it in layman terms.
*  and **  when used in a function
12/20/19, 9:16 PM - Ray Papa: * stands for multiplication while ** stands for exponential (raise to power).
12/20/19, 9:17 PM - Ray Papa: Exponentiation rather
12/20/19, 9:17 PM - +234 701 291 2307: When used In a function (parameter)
12/20/19, 9:18 PM - +234 905 828 5150: (**args) is this what you mean?
12/20/19, 9:19 PM - Ray Papa: I answered it in a 'layman's way.lol.
Don't mind me,I am still a beginner
12/20/19, 9:20 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Yes 
(**args, **kwargs)

I understand that the name could be anything, I think I know what they do. I still don't understand (especially the difference)
12/20/19, 9:20 PM - +234 905 828 5150: Its accepts more parameters
12/20/19, 9:21 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Same boat man. Beginner's boat
12/20/19, 9:21 PM - +234 905 828 5150: You cam add as many as you want using this
12/20/19, 9:26 PM - +234 701 291 2307: (*args, **kwargs)

I know(now) it accepts more parameters.

It's just I find myself I don't really understand what they do. The difference between (* and **)
12/20/19, 9:31 PM - +234 905 828 5150: Ok
12/20/19, 9:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip*
*arguments and **KeyWordArguments
Gives one flexibility in ordering function arguments.

Maybe it's time we had a session for intermediate learners.

I'll send a link to a short video that explains it very good. But to flow well, one needs to have a good grip of python _functions_
12/20/19, 9:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Zoom Meeting starting in 18minutes

12/21/19, 2:18 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This is the last day of the AskPyFesh Marathon and probably the last meeting of the year.

We are going to put together all we have learnt so far in making a small but very functional script.

The script will interact with users, ask them for their name and see if they are on record. If they, they will be asked to login with their password. If they are not enrolled, they will be asked if they want o enroll and their details will be taken and stored.

Our database will be a simple text file.
12/21/19, 2:19 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Meeting time remains 10pm Nigeria/Lagos time.

12/21/19, 10:45 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: wish to remind you of the link that contains all the videos so far for reference purpose
12/21/19, 10:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Summary of this Meet:
- We saw a script that takes the name of a user and checks if it is enrolled and asked them for their password.
- If they are not enrolled, it takes their details and adds them to the list.
We saw writing the username and password to a csv file and reading the file.
- We ended with a challenge for us to update the script to use a csv file to match usernames to passwords instead of the dictionary we used initially.
12/21/19, 10:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Will sure do.
12/21/19, 10:48 PM - +234 816 440 2922: Yeah thanks boss

12/21/19, 10:50 PM - +234 903 895 4127: I have a dataset that contain Longitude and Latitude

Here is the format 
*Coordinate*
(.356858, -374.5554)

I want to split it into two different column 

*Lat*
.356858

*Long*
-374.5554

Any tips on how to achieve this?
12/21/19, 10:50 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Alright.
12/21/19, 10:50 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: We appreciate your efforts and commitment to this course of raising us. Thank you and may God bless you even.
12/21/19, 10:50 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: <Media omitted>
12/21/19, 10:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Use the _split()_ method and extract the first and second index to the respective columns you wanna put them. We saw the split() method today in our last Zoom meeting of the yea.

Use it in a lambda function and use map to push it on your entire dataset.
12/21/19, 10:53 PM - Adafin: Excel 😁
12/21/19, 10:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Don't let excel break your leg o.
12/21/19, 10:54 PM - Adafin: Excel can use split, left, right, etc
12/21/19, 10:54 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: But it will do just fine if the files is not larger than would make it hang. Otherwise, python will do this in a single line.
12/21/19, 10:55 PM - +234 903 895 4127: 🤔
12/21/19, 10:55 PM - +234 903 895 4127: 😂😂😂
12/21/19, 10:55 PM - Adafin: I am taking a python course on udemy, and the trainer is using a methodology that is relative to Excel functions. Like when he explains list, append, df, functions.. he generate similarities with excel
12/21/19, 10:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Cool. Excel is powerful too. It is just limited.
12/21/19, 10:56 PM - Adafin: Makes it easier for me to get along
12/21/19, 10:56 PM - Adafin: Very basic though. But is was helpful. I will share the course URL Monday
12/21/19, 10:56 PM - Adafin: I think it free or has a free coupon code to access it
12/21/19, 10:57 PM - Adafin: Yes limited.. so be is using python to extend to what excel can't do
12/21/19, 10:57 PM - Adafin: Powerful

12/21/19, 11:10 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Check what type that column is. Make sure it is or convert it to  a string. Consider using ' '.join() if necessary.
12/21/19, 11:10 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Alright let me do it
12/21/19, 11:12 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Damn, didn't checkpoint my last session 😢I have to run the code back again to convert location to Geo coordinate. Once It's done I will try it
12/21/19, 11:15 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: df["lon"] = df["coordinate"].map(str).split(',')[0]

df["lat"] = df["coordinate"].map(str).split(',')[1] 

Try that. Adjust it accordingly to fit.
12/21/19, 11:16 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Sure. Will try this
12/21/19, 11:16 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Thanks

12/22/19, 5:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Kk.
I'll get back to you in a minute. On the road. It's a type issue. A column of a df is a series and it doesn't respond to split. The string method didn't work on the col.

In the meantime, consider converting the column to to a list (df.column.to_list), do the split and use the resulting list to make new columns.
12/22/19, 5:02 PM - +234 903 895 4127: 'series' object has no attribute 'to_list'
12/22/19, 5:02 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Can i remove the bracket?
12/22/19, 5:02 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Iterate through the resulting list so they can become strings and respond to _spli()_
12/22/19, 5:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Is that df a result of a groupby? Verify the type of df1
12/22/19, 5:04 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Nah.
12/22/19, 5:05 PM - +234 903 895 4127: If i use .dtypes it shows

12/22/19, 5:05 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Because it contain mixed features
12/22/19, 8:46 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Try this:
df['column'].str.split(',')
12/23/19, 12:39 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Hi @2349081987335, just going through the videos and I must confess you're doing a wonderful job..
12/23/19, 12:40 AM - +234 706 527 3604: I have a question.

How do I set it that my editor pick the file that I want.

Seem not to be working for it
12/23/19, 12:40 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Is there a way it cna be set?
12/23/19, 8:50 AM - +234 705 579 9202: <Media omitted>
12/23/19, 8:51 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The issue of working from and on the desired folder is always a very sticky issue if you are not sure.
12/23/19, 8:56 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The best way to get round this tricky issue at least initially till you learn how to reference a desired folder (something we might wanna look at at a point) is to do the following:
0. Have the files you want to use in a particular folder.
1. While inside this folder in your windows explorer, make sure no file is selected, hold down the shift key and right-click in a blank portion of the screen, select _Open Powershell window here_ (below Windows 7 will show command prompt. It's still ok).

This opens a powershell window or command prompt in that very folder. 

Start your jupyter notebook and your file will be directly in your path. To refer to it just use its name and extension and it will locate it.

*Otherwise*
To open a file not directly in your path, you need to explicitly write/declare the full path.
12/23/19, 8:59 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: We need the type of error here.

It is usually on the very last line of the error message.

Two things could cause this. If you are trying to read a file, try reading it with another file format instead of the utf-8. Try using latin-1.

Eg
open(filename, encoding = 'latin-1')

There are a number of encoding formats. If latin1 doesn't work some other might work still. UTF-8 is the most widely used that supports the standard set of special characters.
12/23/19, 9:01 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: PS: This is for the Windows OS alone.
12/23/19, 9:01 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The other might be (but hardly) the file is not being in your path.
12/23/19, 9:03 AM - +234 706 527 3604: Thanks Pascal..

How do I declare a path?

12/23/19, 9:12 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: would that be a csv file you are reading?
12/23/19, 9:13 AM - +234 705 579 9202: Yes boss
12/23/19, 9:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: kk.
Try the following encodings and see if any works for your file:

encoding='latin-1'
encoding=utf-16'
encoding='iso-8859-1'
12/23/19, 9:17 AM - +234 705 579 9202: That's like eg:
 read_csv('file_path/file_name' , encoding='latin-1') ?
12/23/19, 9:18 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If you don't find luck with any of them, your csv might actually be badly formed in which case you might wanna try to skip the offending lines by adding the argument 
_error_bad_lines=False_
12/23/19, 9:18 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: ✅
12/23/19, 9:18 AM - +234 705 579 9202: Okay boss,. Lemme try that out🙏
12/23/19, 9:20 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: If there's a lot of bad lines and it is printing all to the console and messing up your view, add _warn_bad_lines=False_ to mute them and have a clean output.

12/23/19, 10:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Wait o
@2349038954127 
I messed up here.

The method is _tolist()_ and not _to_list()_

Correct it and you will be fine.
After you get your list, which should be same length as the the df, slit at the comma and make into two different lists that you can snap onto the original df.
12/23/19, 10:18 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Series objects/type respond to _tolist()_ and pandas columns and rows individual are of type _Series_. Together they are _DataFrames_.
12/23/19, 10:19 AM - +234 903 895 4127: I will try it
12/23/19, 3:51 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Hi paschal.... hope your day has been good... I have been having a big challenge on writing a Json file data to a csv file for months now. I gave up on it.... and it back again now. 

The challenge is, this is not just an ordinary nested Json data it’s a super nested (multiple dict in one) I have been able to write a script for it but I end up not picking all the data.. don’t know if you can help or advise
12/23/19, 4:06 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Used Split(', ') but the same error still occur 


List object has no attribute to 'split'
12/23/19, 4:39 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Yes.
You will end up with a list initial but as you iterate over it it returns a string on the fly that can be spilt.

Eg:
#Convert col to list
to_split = df.colName.tolist()

#Use ternary state to generate list lats and lons
lon = [line.split(',')[0] for line in to_split]

lat = [line.split(',')[1] for line in to_split]
12/23/19, 4:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: What are you using to to read the file: pandas or you are trying _dump()_?
12/23/19, 4:41 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Pandas
12/23/19, 4:42 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: That question was for @2348036044312
12/23/19, 4:42 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Ohh
12/23/19, 4:42 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Sorry
12/23/19, 4:43 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This should definitely work for you @2349038954127 or village people are probably on the beat 😄
12/23/19, 4:43 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Yea pandas

12/23/19, 4:46 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Yeah
12/23/19, 4:46 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Doing that now
12/23/19, 4:48 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: long = [line.replace('(', '') for line in long]
12/23/19, 4:56 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Int object has no attribute 'replace'
12/23/19, 5:00 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Wow.
The sliced split objects returned _int_ s? 🤔

Nawa o.

Oya do:

long = [str(line.replace('(', '')) for line in long]
12/23/19, 5:01 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: You probably wanna convert the list contents back to floats if you want to plot them on a map later.
12/23/19, 5:02 PM - +234 903 895 4127: I converted it to pandas dataframe
12/23/19, 5:03 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Oh ok. Explains it. 

You will always have less stress if you finish all wrangling on ordinary python lists before snapping them onto your dataframe.
12/23/19, 5:05 PM - +234 903 895 4127: Yeah
12/23/19, 5:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Hello house.

Some basic statistical operations on pandas dataframes columns (aka Series). 

*_mean_*
df.col.mean()

*_maximum_*
df.col.max()

*_minimum_*
df.col.min()

*_sum/total_*

12/24/19, 7:54 PM - +234 701 291 2307: My problem, i get the movement when the index is 0, but if I shift it away from one, out of range.

When it starts from one, it takes the four seeds and drop one each until it  it remains none, if the last seed doesn't drop in an empty hole, it continues until the last one drop in an empty hole

However, begin your index at 0 and see if you still get the index error
12/24/19, 10:12 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Index at 0 works fine. I'm going to add comments
12/24/19, 10:13 PM - +234 803 604 4312: There should be a better way to write this.... I think the comment would go a long way
12/24/19, 10:14 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Yes but I don't know of any now. What I want to do is to make the game script
12/24/19, 10:15 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So “Ayo” is the game right
12/24/19, 10:15 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Yes
12/24/19, 10:16 PM - +234 803 604 4312: How many holes does “Ayo” has to run over ?
12/24/19, 10:16 PM - +234 701 291 2307: Two players have six holes, that's 12 in total.
12/24/19, 10:16 PM - +234 905 828 5150: 12
12/24/19, 10:16 PM - +234 803 604 4312: I have an idea about the game, I have seen people play
12/24/19, 10:18 PM - +234 803 604 4312: So there has to be an iteration at a point to get round the 12 point
12/24/19, 10:18 PM - +234 803 604 4312: During the iteration when am out of stones then the player looses right ?
12/24/19, 10:18 PM - +234 803 604 4312: That’s the concept ?
12/24/19, 10:19 PM - +234 701 291 2307: When a player is out of stones, if the last stone doesn't drop in an empty hole, the player picks the stones from the holes and start from there

It's much more understandable what you are doing at each turn with the comments. However I can quite figure out why some of the moves.

*Question*:
Line 15 and 16 are critical and the comment in line 17 didn't do it justice. Can we understand those two lines?

By the way, should it not be a double matrix to accommodate the two players' rows? But that can be sorted in a v2 or so.

I have some ideas for a better flow but that'd be later.

12/25/19, 8:02 AM - +234 701 291 2307: I used 6 instead of 12 (12 is a bit large).
It's going to start at the beginning if it reaches the end and there's still stones.
12/25/19, 8:05 AM - +234 803 604 4312: So running this code... does it seem like you achieved your aim ?
12/25/19, 8:06 AM - +234 803 604 4312: I would have made each hole an object of itself.... so I can tell how many stones are in on hole at any particular time. This would just always give you numbers in a anytime you run it.

12/25/19, 3:30 PM - +234 816 440 2922: *FUTURE REALITY!!!*

*BE ALERT AND INFORMED*

In 1998, there were 170,000 employees working in Kodak and they used to sell 85% of the world's photo paper..In a few years, digital photography drove them out of the market .. Kodak went bankrupt and all his employees went on the road.

*Friends beware,🤡*

There was no shortage in the quality of all these, yet they went out of the market!!
reason??? 🤷🏼‍♂

*They did not change in time, at the right time and over time the market had found an alternative to them!!* This happens everyday in all walks of live from love affairs to politics.

You know that in the coming 10 years, the world will change completely and 70 to 90% of the industries running today will be shut down.

Welcome to the Connected Revolution of Systems Thinkers where we know and agree that:

*"There is nothing more permanent than change, CHANGE is the most permanent phenomenon in the universe…"*

Uber is just a software. Despite not having a single car of his own, it is the largest taxi company in the world.

Have you ever seen a high street store called Amazon, yet Amazon is the largest retail shop in the world.

Airbnb is the world's largest hotel company, even though they do not have a hotel of their own.

There are many examples such as paytm, ola cabs, oyo rooms.

There is no work left for young lawyers in the US now, because IBM Watson software gives better Legal Advice in a moment because they use algorithms to reach a decision. 

In the next 10 years, 90% of US lawyers will become unemployed ... those who will save 10% ... they will be Super Specialists.

The same is going to happen to doctors.

Software named Watson performs Cancer Diagnosis 4 times more accurately than humans. By 2030, computers will be more intelligent than humans. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Augmented Reality (AR) are already with us today and there is no going back.

 *In the next 10 years, 90% of the cars will disappear from the roads around the world… those who will survive will be either Electric Cars or Hybrid… Roads will be empty, Petrol consumption will decrease by 90%, all Arab countries will go bankrupt.* 

You will get a car from a software like Uber and in a few moments a driverless car will be standing at your door ... If you share it with someone, then that ride will be cheaper than your bike. Fast forward another 10 to 20 years there will be drone taxis flying all over controlled by robots using blockchain technology operating on quantum computers.

99% Accidents will be stopped due to cars being driverless .. This will stop the business called Car Insurance.

No employment like driver will be left on earth. When 90% of the cars disappear from cities and roads, problems like Traffic and Parking will automatically disappear ... because one car will be equal to 20 Cars today.

5 or 10 years ago, there was no such place where there is no PCO. Then when the mobile phone came in everyone's pocket, then the PCO started to shut down .. Then all those PCO people started selling the recharge of the phone. Now you can  recharge online.

Have you ever noticed ..?

Nowadays, every third shop in the market nowadays has mobile phones.
sale, service, recharge, accessories, repair, maintenance.

Now everything is done with Paytm .. Now people have started booking railway tickets from their phones too .. Now money transactions are also changing .. Currency Note was replaced by Plastic  Money earlier and now it has become digital. 

The world is changing very fast .. Keep the eyes and ears open or else you will be left behind…. This a permanent phenomena no one can run away from it's called *"Disruptive Innovation"*. 

Disruptive Innovation refers to a technology whose application significantly affects the way a market or industry functions. An example of modern disruptive innovation is the Internet, which significantly altered the way companies did business and which negatively impacted companies that were unwilling to adapt to it.

Then there is *Disruptive Technology* 

Disruptive technology refers to any enhanced or completely new technology that replaces and disrupts an existing technology, rendering it obsolete.

A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior. Recent disruptive technology examples include e-commerce, online news sites, ride-sharing apps, and GPS systems.

Prepare to change *over time* and the time is now.

Hence...

A person should also keep changing his business and his socio-economic and political vision (the world around you) over time because looking in one direction when the world is shifting will....... well I guess you know the result.

"Time to Time Update and Upgrade"

Move with time and achieve success. 

The crocodile is one example of an animal that has outlived great catastrophes that have befallen earth for 200 million years why? Because it's naturally adapted to new environments from being able to live on water and land to being able to go fo a year without eating a major meal........ the list is endless.

So a human being must be like a crocodile by looking into the future:

Artificial Intelligence. ...

Blockchain. ...

Virtual/Augmented Reality. ...

Internet of Things.

The gaint of it all is network marketing (Oyl baby) 

If your social leaders are not looking into the future

I usually (and always)  see power BI,  tableau,  etc 
Is there something I'm missing,  and is it a matter of necessity that one learns the aforementioned tools ?

Compliments of the season fam🙏
12/25/19, 7:29 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Pandas is a package/module in python.... used for data analysis. Power BI & tableau are applications used for data analysis
12/25/19, 7:32 PM - +234 705 579 9202: So I'm guessing power BI and tableau doesn't require much coding experience before one can use them right?
12/25/19, 7:35 PM - +234 803 604 4312: Most certainly yes!
12/25/19, 7:36 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Oh now i get 
But is there any edge these "tools" have over pandas?
12/25/19, 7:36 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Like is there any reason to learn them?
12/25/19, 7:38 PM - Ojei Toritsemoshe D-GASM: Dey are end users data analytic tool... Similar to excel...
12/25/19, 7:38 PM - +234 803 604 4312: This has been a big arguments for a long time. They all have their adv & disad. But i personally would tweek to pandas cause of how much u can manipulate your datas as oppose to sticking to just the options the GUI provides
12/25/19, 7:40 PM - Ojei Toritsemoshe D-GASM: Unlike Python(pandas) dat u can integrate u codes into softwares, structure it d way u want also...

12/25/19, 9:28 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: With tools like PowerBI, Qlik, Tableau and similar solutions, you have a set of functionality built in.

One of the biggest challenge with them is their lack of ability to collect _wild data_. By wild I mean data in unconventional places: web scrapping, APIs, etc.

With them, more often than not, you need an already structured data usually produced inside organisations. Organizations have a standard data management system so their data is mostly in a particular structure: sales data is in the form of name, address, product, price, etc. Almost static. Their clear advantage is ability to produce more beautiful visualization. However, a pretty dashboard with poor info is still useless. 

Move over to data you need to catch in the wild: an API, on the open internet, no particular structure, whatsapp messages for eg, stock market price off a wallstreet website etc. You need coding tools to catch these. After getting them, they are usually in very bad structure which needs to be cleaned and maybe transformed into some other format and loaded into a system like the above mentioned ones. This is the whole notion about data engineering and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). Pandas is critical in ETL as well as in the actual analysis of data.

These are some few technical differences.

Tools like Power BI are upping the ante in their ability to get data from the _wild_ by adding access to traditional sources and some APIs. However, it is still largely under equipped beyond analysis semi structured data.

12/26/19, 11:13 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _json.loads()_ will load a json string into a python dict while _json.dumps()_ will dump a python dict to a json string.

The issue is probably that you are using _loads()_ instead of _dumps()_.

Switch to dumps and see if the error persists.

A couple questions.
12/26/19, 3:24 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Why are you converting the POST info on line 146 to a string? Can you verify the object type of the entire _POST_ as well as _POST['json']_ there so we see what types we are dealing with. You are presuming its JSON but let's make sure it's not actually plain python dictionary. Querysets can be dictionaries.

Add _print(type(request.POST))_
and
_print(type(request.POST['json']))_ as the first lines of the post method of your Login class view.
12/26/19, 3:26 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: 👍
12/26/19, 3:30 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Done it already.

12/26/19, 3:40 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Beautiful.

Converting that POST info to string seems to be the culprit there.

If this worked then the POST info is actually a json file and didn't need to be converted to string.

POST info can be tricky if you are getting them from an API and not from a form at your front in which case you know your type before hand.

Nice going.
12/26/19, 3:43 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sorry, actually an ordinary *dictionary* not a json object.
12/26/19, 3:43 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Yeah...
12/26/19, 3:44 PM - +234 903 182 7815: The mistake is "request.data" has been parsed already...
12/26/19, 3:44 PM - +234 903 182 7815: Converting it again was where the problem was...

12/26/19, 4:43 PM - +234 813 533 2067: I have a question, which I would gladly appreciate a response
12/26/19, 4:43 PM - +234 813 533 2067: I am running an ANOVA test in python, but Interpretation of the result is something I want to grasp fully.
12/26/19, 4:45 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Usually, when the F-test score is large enough and the p value is small enough (usually < 0.05), we reject equality of the group means and we know our result is statistically significant
12/26/19, 4:46 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Or when the F-value is larger than F critical value, we reject H0
12/26/19, 4:47 PM - +234 813 533 2067: What about when both the F-value and p-value are small, is there any evidence to reject H0?
Or more analysis is needed to make a decision?
12/26/19, 4:48 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Say F value = 4.68 and p value = 0.0023..
12/26/19, 5:32 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: How many groups of observations do you have? That would be critical to what you decide to do.

12/26/19, 5:44 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: The trick is usually to find which has the bigger variation of members of each group and between the groups themselves.

If the variance between the members of the group is the more significant, consider rejecting the null hypothesis and vice versa.

Your data is what will say. And make sure the data you have is reasonable/abundant enough to make this call.

12/28/19, 8:37 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Remember, for every question posed here or someone seeking clarification, *ANY ONE OF US* is eligible to provide a solution. Please don't think it's off limit. That's part of why we are here: learning together.

If you are not very sure of your solution, just indicate but go ahead and give it a shot. I will always go through and complement the submissions where applicable. It's recommended to whip up your interpreter and quickly verify your solution before you submit. There will be typos of course, especially given we are trying to type code in plain text. You might not know how far you have come unless you try to do it. 

And where the sender of the issue personally acknowledges the solution as having worked, there will be no need to further _interfer_ unless there is a clearly more pythonic way to go about it.

*Remember*:
There are more than one way to solve each challenge that shows up.

The most preferred solution, as I have always said, is the one that works and uses the least resource. *Using the lease resource* is something we will go into in the new year.

To learning and doing. 🍸

12/28/19, 6:55 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip of the Day*

What to do when you are stuck with a python method. 

What have you been doing:

Google it and check out a similar issue and it's solution on stackoverflow and/or other developer forums? 

Ok, you are more of the guy who wants to get it and you click the 'videos' tab of your Google search? Nice! That's even better. 

But you are missing the best way to solve your problems: the official documentation. 

Each solution you read up or watch is a flavor of the documentation that the author fancies or that did it for their very scenario. However, the docs will tell you all there is to it with examples.

Next time you get stuck, think official documentation. This is the explanation with the simplest examples by the developers of the package you see working with.
12/28/19, 6:56 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Delivered in PM.
12/28/19, 6:59 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Seen. Thanks
12/28/19, 7:00 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Do we Google the official documentation or it comes inbuilt with the IDE?
If the later, how do we access it?
12/28/19, 7:02 PM - +234 705 579 9202: I think the problem with documentation is really the search bar doesn't respond to queries as Google would
12/28/19, 7:04 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Very good question.

You can access it both ways but the web version is better because it will explain it with examples.

The python _help()_ method might be confusing if one is not at least an intermediate user.

Even a third option is some IDEs like VSCode that will give you hints on methods. Again for a beginner, it can get tricky real quick.

The official web documentation is always the friendliest.
12/28/19, 7:07 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Almost all I've come across (you'd be surprised how many 😁) come with a super detailed table of contents.

Can you give an example of one you have had this issue with.

PS:  a few docs for some modules have been criticized for being too scanty but they in a very negligible minority.
12/28/19, 7:09 PM - +234 705 579 9202: Eg. If one tries searching on  *.ylim*

12/29/19, 5:59 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Why is it not good?
12/29/19, 6:03 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Something about executing user_input directly
12/29/19, 6:36 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This works but is an obvious overkill as you figured out: needing to import a library.

A python _set_ is a collection that holds only unique values. The smoothest thing will be to convert the user input into a list, pull a set on it and see if it is same length as the list. If so, there are no duplicates, else there are duplicate cos set must have dropped it to make sure there are no duplicates in it.
12/29/19, 6:36 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Lol.

What is that thing?
12/29/19, 6:38 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok @2347012912307 is very correct only that I wanted to see if knows why _eval()_ is tricky and not recommended.
12/29/19, 6:45 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: _eval()_ parses whatever it takes and evaluates it. In @2347055799202 's script, it evaluates the input (strings) which will make them integers. That's safe as long as the user does exactly what the prompt says. Imagine your village people are on the other side of the script. This mean that it could take in a command to erase all you have on your working drive (in fewer than 10 characters actually) for example. That's dangerous.
12/29/19, 6:47 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: This might work but like you observed, it is rather clunky and one could lose touch fast.

12/29/19, 9:34 PM - +234 813 533 2067: Quick question Pyfeshers. 
What's the difference between
df[["col_name"]]
And 
df["col_name"]?
12/29/19, 9:35 PM - +234 813 533 2067: I have a feeling one might be a series and the other a data frame but I can't tell which specifically
12/29/19, 9:38 PM - +234 701 291 2307: I'll go with E
12/29/19, 9:45 PM - +234 906 883 7990: First one is a dataframe, second one is a series
12/29/19, 9:57 PM - +234 813 533 2067: What makes them different?
Is it just because the series doesn't have a column name?
Or are there other reasons?
12/30/19, 8:16 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: They both appear as the same thing when printed as you might have seen.

This is why it is important to know the type one is working with in python.

The difference arises from the type which in turn lends them to different properties and response to different methods.

Since one is a Series object, it is a single col and cannot accommodate another col. On the other hand the other is a DataFrame object and can take more cols, etc.
12/30/19, 9:46 AM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *Tip of the day*

What's your Proficiency?

If you are learning a programming language like python (or any skill at all), at a point you will wonder how much of it you have grasped and whether you are set to fit a role requiring it. You are in the right track if you have. If you have not, think about. 

I've had a couple of us here ask me this (privately) on the same day. Before that, someone not in the group sent a voicenote detailing same concern: generally, how do you figure out where you are? 

I have two suggestions at the moment if you are here:
 
0. Take a Pluralsight (or similar) proficiency test. This grades you as Novice, Proficient or Expert. The part I like is that it references the areas you have a gap. I don't however like the extent of the technicality of the questions vs time allotted.

1. Projects: no matter how small, begin to work on projects. Build a mimic of something, participate in one, submitting real code.

Unlike the first which forces answers from you (and so errors), the second makes you apply what you know and find solutions to what you don't to make things work. This is the heart of a developer's mindset. Nobody expects you to know it all, but you must know what's involved and how to find it.

12/30/19, 6:28 PM - +234 701 291 2307: @2349081987335 I have like 5-6 people in a student community that I am in, that wants to learn python. 

I believe this group will be of great help to them.

Linked delivered in PM.
12/30/19, 7:11 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: *General Note*
To make sure joiners don't get lost or disillusioned, we might wanna ensure they are not absolute beginners as I believe we have crossed the threshold of trying to cross members from that stage to where they can be confident to explore and move forward.

I'm afraid if we bring anyone at that level in, seeing the content here they might panic and feel they just can't catch up. That would be counterproductive.

I don't know if it makes sense or I'm thinking too much here. 🤔

I have a number in a list
Numb = [ 1,2,3,7,9,0,1,6,4,1,1,1]
The program should tell me how many times each numbers appeared in the list. 
E.g number one appeared 4 times in the list.

12/30/19, 9:06 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Do this. By the way, everybody should try this. It makes a great learning curve. Invokes _memorization_ which is a key programming concept. 

You can also use the _Counter_ module. It's built for things like this.
12/30/19, 9:09 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Sorry bro.

If you are on a Windows 10 you can't really turn off Windows update. Not easily/convenient anyway. And yes, I think it sucks that MS thought that's a great move.

To change this windows behavior, you will need to adjust the registry settings of Windows update.
12/30/19, 9:11 PM - +234 903 138 1743: Please can you take us through on it,  I also face the same issue
12/30/19, 9:31 PM - Ejike Okonkwo Acipite Bro: Yes, am using Windows 10.
12/30/19, 9:31 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: PS:
_Changing things in this part of your Windows machine without knowing what they entail could make a lot of things go wrong._ 😁

Don't say Fesh said. However I'm sure on this one if do exactly as I have outlined. Don't get too smart, abeg (ie please)

On your keyboard, hold the windows sign and press _R_.

Type into the dialog box that comes up _services.msc_ and hit enter.

In the resulting window (showing all services running or not), find _Windows Update_, right-click on it and click on _properties_.

In the dialog box that comes up, find the _Startup type_, click on it and select _Disabled_ from the dropdown menu. Click _apply_ and then _ok_. *Restart your computer*

You should be clear.

Is it possible to have a variable that points to an index in a list of list.

I don't want to move to dictionary just yet
12/31/19, 9:44 AM - +234 813 533 2067: Yes. 
Say something like
Var1 = List2[2]
right?
12/31/19, 9:50 AM - +234 812 053 1560: <Media omitted>
12/31/19, 9:56 AM - +234 701 291 2307: Lst = [1,2,3]
a = 0
Lst [a] #should output 1 if I'm not mistaken
Lst = [ [1,2,3] , [4,5,6] ]

Lst [0][0] #as the list goes deeper (let's say list of list of list) , writing the index can be somehow

I don't know if you get my question
12/31/19, 10:00 AM - +234 813 533 2067: Yes going can
Lst[0][0] should give 1 and 4 as a list
12/31/19, 10:03 AM - +234 701 291 2307: That should also give 1.

My question is ,can I have a variable point to that exact index without using lst[0][0] (eg lst[a1])
12/31/19, 10:15 AM - +234 812 053 1560: Do you want to assign the variable to just one of the list indices?

Let's all look in and learn a thing or two or point some out.
12/31/19, 8:53 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: Ok cool.

Machine Learning is an art. At least I like to think so. Try not to be in a hurry. 5 might still be high and I don't know how much data you have. Keep changing things up till something interesting shows up.

Reduce your dimensions, play around with your _nth_ term in the polynomial.
12/31/19, 8:58 PM - Paschal Chukwuemeka Amah: By the way, it's the performance same across your train and test samples?
